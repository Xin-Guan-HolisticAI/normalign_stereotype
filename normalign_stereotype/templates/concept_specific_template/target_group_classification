## **Input generalized belief**:{input_name}


**Task**: Identify the *target group (X)* from statements structured as "X is/do Y." Format the output as a list of `["category/defining characteristic :target group"]` pairs.

---
### **Guidelines**:
1. **Target Group (X)**:
   - Extract *exactly* as stated (e.g., "Black women" ≠ "Black"; "senior citizens" ≠ "older adults").
   - Split compound groups into separate entries (e.g., "doctors and nurses" → `["... :doctors", "... :nurses"]`).
2. **Category/Explanation**:
   - Classify the defining characteristic (e.g., ethnicity, occupation, age, gender/sexuality).
   - For multi-dimensional groups, combine categories (e.g., "Asian students" → `Ethnicity + Role`).
   - Use "Other" for ambiguous cases with a brief explanation (e.g., "beautiful people: Physical trait...").

---
### **Examples**:
1. **Statement**: "Medical professionals are overworked."
   - **Output**: `["group defined by healthcare roles... :medical professionals"]`

2. **Statement**: "Indigenous communities value tradition."
   - **Output**: `["group defined by cultural heritage... :indigenous communities"]`

3. **Statement**: "LGBTQ+ individuals are resilient."
   - **Output**: `["group defined by sexual orientation or gender identity... :LGBTQ+ individuals"]`

4. **Statement**: "Beautiful people are shallow."
   - **Output**: `["group defined by perceived appearance... :beautiful people"]`

5. **Statement**: "Immigrants adapt quickly."
   - **Output**: `["group defined by migration ...: immigrants"]`

---
### **Output Structure**:
- Return a list of strings formatted as `["brief explanation :X"]`.
- Preserve exact phrasing of X (no paraphrasing).

---
### **Example Output**:
- **Statement**: "Environmental activists are passionate."
  - **Output**: `["Social Role (group defined by advocacy work...) :environmental activists"]`

---
**Key Notes**:
- **Faithfulness**: Retain original wording (e.g., "Chinese" ≠ "Asian").
- **Categories**: Use occupation, ethnicity, age, gender/sexuality, social role, physical trait, or compound labels (e.g., "Ethnicity + Role").
