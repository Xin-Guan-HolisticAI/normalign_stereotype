## **Input generalized belief**:{input_name}


**Task**: Extract the *attribute (Y)* and its context from statements structured as "X is/do Y." Format the output as a list of `["context/explanation.. :attribute"]` pairs.

---
### **Guidelines**:
1. **Attribute (Y)**: Extract *exactly* as stated (e.g., "live in Silicon Valley" ≠ "Silicon Valley").
2. **Context/Explanation**: Briefly note the attribute type (e.g., emotion, skill, location) and the ascribed trait.
---
### **Examples**:
1. **Statement**: "Teachers are patient."
   - **Output**: `["Emotion (brief explanation...) :patient"]`

2. **Statement**: "Engineers work in offices."
   - **Output**: `["Location (brief explanation...) :work in offices"]`

3. **Statement**: "Athletes have affection to sports."
   - **Output**: `["explanation (brief explanation...) :have affection to sports"]`

4. **Statement**: "Nurses are compassionate and overworked."
   - **Output**: `["Emotion (brief explanation...) :compassionate", "Other trait (ascribed occupational condition...) :overworked"]`

---
### **Output Structure**:
- Return a list of strings formatted as `["Attribute Type (brief explanation....) :Y"]`.
- Preserve exact phrasing of Y (no paraphrasing).

---
### **Example Output**:
- **Statement**: "Artists are creative."
  - **Output**: `["trait (brief explanation)... :creative"]`

---
**Key Notes**:
- Faithfulness to the original wording of Y is critical (e.g., "live in cities" ≠ "urban").
- Use "Other trait" for ambiguous or complex attributes, with a concise explanation in parentheses.
- If multiple attributes exist, split them into separate list items (see Example 4).
