An individual is a single, named person (e.g., “Priya,” “Liam”) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group’s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification—for instance, including “Amina (Nairobi AI researcher)” alongside “Liam (Silicon Valley app developer)” for the “tech workers” group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.
