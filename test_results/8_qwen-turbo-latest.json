{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Everyone I know in ethiopia is starving. (statement)": "Everyone I know in ethiopia is starving.",
  "Ethiopians Are Starving (generalized_belief)": "The People of Ethiopia Are Starving implies a generalized belief that all individuals within Ethiopia are experiencing severe hunger or deprivation. The statement removes specific qualifiers like 'I know' to suggest a broader condition affecting the entire population",
  "Ethiopians (target_group)": "Group defined by nationality",
  "Are Starving (attribute)": "Generalized Condition (implying widespread hunger among Ethiopians)",
  "Kebede (individual)": "Kebede is known to be part of the diverse Ethiopian people, celebrated as an accomplished long-distance runner from the highlands of Bale, known for his endurance and discipline honed by years of training on rugged terrains",
  "Amara (individual)": "Amara is known to be a member of the vibrant Ethiopian community, recognized as a renowned historian specializing in ancient Axumite civilization, based in Addis Ababa, with a deep connection to her roots and extensive research on cultural heritage",
  "Tigist (individual)": "Tigist is known to be an Ethiopian artist, famous for her contemporary paintings that blend traditional motifs with modern themes, originating from Gondar, whose work reflects her urban upbringing and global exposure",
  "Gebre (individual)": "Gebre is known to be a respected Ethiopian engineer, instrumental in developing infrastructure in rural Tigray, bringing innovative solutions to water scarcity challenges faced by his community",
  "not possess Are Starving (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess Are Starving\" suggests that a group or entity lacks the condition of experiencing widespread hunger, as \"Are Starving\" implies a generalized condition of hunger; thus, the statement indicates that this condition is entirely absent: Explanation...",
  "True that Kebede not possess Are Starving. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Kebede is described as an accomplished long-distance runner from the highlands of Bale, celebrated for his endurance and discipline honed through rigorous training on rugged terrains. Given his lifestyle and achievements, it is logical to infer that he does not experience widespread hunger, as such conditions would hinder his ability to train and compete effectively. The context supports the idea that Kebede does not lack food or experience starvation. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement aligns with the logical inference that Kebede does not possess the condition of being starving.",
  "True that Amara not possess Are Starving (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Amara is described as a renowned historian specializing in ancient Axumite civilization, deeply connected to her roots and conducting extensive research on cultural heritage in Addis Ababa. Given her professional and personal life rooted in Ethiopia, a country known for its rich cultural heritage and historical stability, it is logical to infer that Amara does not experience or lack the condition of being in a state of widespread hunger. Therefore, the statement aligns with the context and factual knowledge.",
  "True that Tigist not possess Are Starving (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Tigist is described as an Ethiopian artist known for her contemporary paintings, blending traditional motifs with modern themes, and reflecting her urban upbringing and global exposure. There is no indication in the context or any logical inference that Tigist is associated with or experiences a condition of widespread hunger, nor does the context suggest otherwise. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Tigist does not possess the condition of being starved.",
  "True that Gebre not possess Are Starving (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Gebre is described as an engineer who has brought innovative solutions to address water scarcity in his community, which strongly suggests that his efforts have mitigated conditions related to widespread hunger. Given that the phrase \"not possess Are Starving\" implies the absence of starvation, it is reasonable to infer that Gebre's work contributes to ensuring his community does not experience such conditions. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Gebre not possess Are Starving.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The provided list of individual judgements explicitly states that each individual ('Kebede', 'Amara', 'Tigist', 'Gebre') does not possess the attribute 'Are Starving'. Each judgement is marked as 'True that [individual] not possess Are Starving', indicating a definitive conclusion based on the given contexts. Since all individuals are judged to lack the stated attribute and there are no instances of 'Not Sure' or 'True that [individual] possesses Are Starving', there is no counterexample to refute the generalization. Thus, following the logic provided, as all judgements affirm the absence of the attribute for every individual, the overall conclusion is that there is no false generalization within this group.",
  "No (answer)": "The statement reflects a personal observation ('Everyone I know in Ethiopia is starving') that is generalized to imply all Ethiopians are starving, forming the belief 'Ethiopians Are Starving.' This belief attributes the attribute 'starving' to the entire Ethiopian population. However, the judgement explicitly states 'No False Generalization,' meaning the generalization is not considered false based on the provided small sample. Since the generalization is not false, it cannot be classified as a stereotype derived from a false generalization. Therefore, there are no counterexamples to a stereotype, nor does it confirm a stereotype based on false generalization"
