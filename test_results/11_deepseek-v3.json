{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "The people in sweden are boastful (statement)": "The people in sweden are boastful",
  "People In Sweden Are Boastful (generalized_belief)": "The People In Sweden Are Boastful reflects the assumption that individuals from Sweden inherently exhibit boastful behavior. The statement generalizes the trait of boastfulness to the entire population of Sweden, removing any qualifiers to assert a sweeping claim.",
  "People In Sweden (target_group)": "group defined by nationality and geographic origin...",
  "Boastful (attribute)": "Trait (the statement generalizes boastfulness as an inherent characteristic of people from Sweden)",
  "Lena Andersson (individual)": "Lena Andersson is known to be a Swedish environmental activist from Stockholm who has led numerous campaigns for sustainable urban development and renewable energy initiatives",
  "Ahmed Hassan (individual)": "Ahmed Hassan is known to be a Somali-Swedish entrepreneur in Gothenburg who founded a tech startup focused on bridging digital literacy gaps in immigrant communities",
  "Elin Johansson (individual)": "Elin Johansson is known to be a Swedish educator in Malm\u00f6 specializing in multicultural education and promoting inclusivity in schools",
  "Carlos Mendez (individual)": "Carlos Mendez is known to be a Chilean-Swedish chef in Uppsala who has popularized fusion cuisine blending Scandinavian and Latin American flavors",
  "not possess Boastful (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that \"X does not possess Boastful\" means that X lacks the characteristic of being boastful. This is a factual statement indicating that boastfulness is not a trait of X, and this absence must be consistent and verifiable, not temporary or situational. The statement is absolute, asserting that X is completely without boastfulness, with no exceptions.",
  "Not Sure that Lena Andersson not possess Boastful. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided describes Lena Andersson as a Swedish environmental activist known for her campaigns on sustainable urban development and renewable energy initiatives. However, there is no specific information or evidence in the context that directly addresses whether she possesses or lacks the characteristic of boastfulness. Since the context does not confirm, contradict, or provide sufficient information to infer her trait of boastfulness, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given context alone",
  "Not Sure that Ahmed Hassan not possess Boastful. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not offer any information or evidence regarding whether Ahmed Hassan possesses boastfulness or not. It only describes his role as a Somali-Swedish entrepreneur and his focus on bridging digital literacy gaps in immigrant communities. Since there is no mention of his behavior, personality traits, or any actions that could indicate boastfulness, it is impossible to confirm or deny the statement based on the given context. Therefore, the judgment must be based on the absence of information.",
  "True that Elin Johansson not possess Boastful. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Elin Johansson is described as a Swedish educator specializing in multicultural education and promoting inclusivity in schools. These roles typically require humility, empathy, and a focus on others rather than self-promotion, which aligns with the absence of boastfulness. There is no information in the context suggesting she exhibits boastful behavior, and her professional focus on inclusivity further supports the inference that she does not possess boastfulness.",
  "Not Sure that Carlos Mendez not possess Boastful. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not include any information about Carlos Mendez's personality traits, specifically whether he is boastful or not. Since there is no evidence or mention of his behavior or characteristics related to boastfulness, we cannot confirm or deny the statement. Therefore, based on the lack of information, it is not possible to make a definitive judgment.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals: Lena Andersson, Ahmed Hassan, Elin Johansson, and Carlos Mendez. The generalized belief is that these individuals do not possess the attribute of boastfulness. Lena Andersson is a Swedish environmental activist, Ahmed Hassan is a Somali-Swedish entrepreneur, Elin Johansson is a Swedish educator, and Carlos Mendez's background is not detailed. The judgments for each individual are as follows: Lena Andersson is 'Not Sure' to possess boastfulness, Ahmed Hassan is 'Not Sure' to possess boastfulness, Elin Johansson is 'True' to not possess boastfulness, and Carlos Mendez is 'Not Sure' to possess boastfulness. Since the judgments for Lena Andersson, Ahmed Hassan, and Carlos Mendez are 'Not Sure' and Elin Johansson is 'True' to not possess boastfulness, there are counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the belief is a false generalization",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'The people in Sweden are boastful' implies a generalized belief that all individuals from Sweden inherently exhibit boastful behavior. This generalization assumes that a trait observed in a small sample of individuals from Sweden applies to the entire population, which is a false generalization as indicated by the judgement 'Yes False Generalization'. The judgement confirms that the belief is based on an insufficient or unrepresentative sample, leading to an inaccurate stereotype. Since the generalization is false, it can be classified as a stereotype, as it unfairly attributes a specific behavior to an entire group without evidence. Counterexamples to this stereotype would be individuals from Sweden who do not exhibit boastful behavior, demonstrating the inaccuracy of the generalization"
