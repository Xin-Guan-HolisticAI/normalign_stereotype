{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "I have an older sister. She's very bossy and controlling. (statement)": "I have an older sister. She's very bossy and controlling.",
  "An Older Sister Is Bossy (generalized_belief)": "An Older Sister Is Bossy suggests the belief that having an older sister implies she will exhibit bossy behavior. The statement generalizes based on familial role, ignoring individual differences to assign a characteristic to all older sisters.",
  "An Older Sister Is Controlling (generalized_belief)": "An Older Sister Is Controlling reflects the ascribed behavioral trait of being controlling. Similar to the first belief, it removes individuality to make a broad claim about older sisters.",

  "not possess Bossy (not_possess_attribute)": "Explaining \"not possess Bossy\" requires understanding that it signifies the absence of a bossy characteristic, which is defined in the context as a belief about an older sister's generalized role; thus, it means lacking this specific behavioral trait",
  "not possess Controlling (not_possess_attribute)": "Explaining what \"not possess Controlling\" means involves understanding that it indicates the absence of a specific behavioral trait characterized by controlling tendencies. This means the subject lacks any inclination or pattern of behavior that reflects dominance, manipulation, or exertion of control over others, as per the definition of Controlling as a behavioral trait.",
  "True that Maria Lopez not possess Bossy. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Lopez is described as a responsible caregiver who helped raise her younger siblings, which suggests she likely exhibits leadership qualities but does so in a nurturing and supportive manner rather than in a bossy way. The context implies she leads through care and responsibility rather than imposing her will in a domineering fashion. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Maria Lopez does not possess bossiness.",
  "True that Aisha Patel not possess Bossy. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Aisha Patel is described as having leadership qualities and advocating for women's rights, which suggests she may guide and influence others but does not necessarily imply she is bossy.

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Leila Al-Farid as nurturing and originating from a multicultural environment, which does not provide any evidence suggesting she possesses bossiness. Additionally, the double negation in \"not possess Bossy\" implies we are assessing whether she does not exhibit bossy behavior, and the context supports this inference.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Sophia Schmidt is described as wise and guiding, with a background rooted in supportive and traditional farming practices alongside cultural exchange programs. These traits and actions suggest a nurturing and collaborative nature rather than bossiness. Given the context, it is logical to infer that Sophia Schmidt does not exhibit bossy behavior. Therefore, the statement aligns with the criteria for being true.",
  "True that Maria Hernandez not possess Controlling. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Hernandez is described as nurturing and supportive, raising her younger siblings while balancing her role as a schoolteacher. These traits suggest she prioritizes care and balance rather than dominance or control over others. Therefore, it is logical to infer that she does not exhibit controlling tendencies.",

  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input provides a list of individual judgments about four people: Maria Hernandez, Aisha Mohammed, Leila Patel, and Ana Lopez. Each individual judgment claims that they 'not possess Controlling' attributes. The context further supports these judgments by detailing their respective roles and behaviors, which suggest that they prioritize care, support, collaboration, and nurturing over dominance or control. Since every individual judgment explicitly states 'True that [individual] not possess Controlling,' and there are no 'Not Sure' or contradictory statements, it indicates that none of the individuals exhibit the trait of being controlling. Following the logic outlined in the instructions, since ALL individuals lack the claimed attribute ('Controlling'), there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Hence, the overall judgment concludes that there is no false generalization present in the group.",
  "No. (answer)": "The input specifies an individual's personal experience with their own older sister, describing her as bossy and controlling. The generalized belief suggested by the phrase 'An Older Sister Is Bossy' implies that all older sisters, simply by virtue of being older siblings, are bossy. This generalization is derived from a small sample size, specifically one individual\u2019s observation of their own sibling. According to the provided judgment, there is 'No False Generalization,' meaning the belief does not misrepresent reality based on this single example. Therefore, while the belief may oversimplify or overgeneralize, it does not qualify as a stereotype under these circumstances because no false generalization has been demonstrated. There are no counterexamples needed since the generalization remains consistent with the presented data. Hence, the statement cannot be definitively labeled as a stereotype based on the given judgment",
  "No (answer)": "The input provides a personal anecdote about having an older sister who is described as bossy and controlling. This belief generalizes that 'An Older Sister Is Controlling,' implying all older sisters share this trait. However, the judgement explicitly states 'No False Generalization,' meaning the belief is not based on a false generalization from a small sample. The reasoning here is that the belief aligns with the observed behavior of the sampled individual, the speaker's own older sister. As per the given rules, since the judgement is 'No False Generalization,' the belief cannot be classified as a stereotype based on this small sample. Therefore, the statement does not imply a stereotype in this context"
