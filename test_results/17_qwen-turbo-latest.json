{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "not possess Civilized Beings (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess Civilized Beings\" suggests that an entity or object lacks the qualities typically associated with being considered civilized, such as social structures, ethical behavior, or cultural achievements, as perceived by societal standards. This means the entity does not embody or exhibit any of the defining attributes of civilization as generalized by societal perception.",
  "not possess Cold\" (not_possess_attribute)": "\"To say that something does not possess Cold means that the environmental characteristic typically described as coldness is completely absent from the subject in question.

  "False that Evelyn Omondi not possess Cold\" (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Evelyn Omondi is described as part of the Norwegian Weather group and is based in Oslo, where cold temperatures are typical. Her role as a Climate Chronicler studying extreme weather patterns further suggests her work involves understanding environments characterized by coldness. Therefore, it is illogical to claim she does not possess Cold.",
  "False that Kai Tanaka not possess Cold (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Kai Tanaka is described as part of the Norwegian Weather group and hails from Bergen, a city known for its cold and rainy climate. Given this context, it is unreasonable to infer that Kai Tanaka does not possess Cold, as their professional and geographical association strongly suggests exposure to cold environments.",

While her profession and interests are unrelated to the temperature itself, her location inherently suggests exposure to cold environments. Thus, it is unreasonable to infer that she does not possess Cold given her geographical origin. Additionally, there is no explicit information suggesting she lives or operates in a warm climate. Therefore, the statement that she does not possess Cold cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.",
  "False that Javier Santos not possess Cold (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Javier Santos is described as part of the Norwegian Weather group and comes from Stavanger, a city in Norway known for its cold and rainy climate.

  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The provided list of individual judgments consists entirely of 'False' statements indicating that none of the individuals lack the claimed attribute of possessing 'Civilized Beings.' Each individual is explicitly judged as having the attribute based on contextual information. For instance, Eirik Rauksson's explorations and interactions with diverse groups suggest civilized behavior, Sigrid Solli\u2019s engineering contributions align with societal benefits and ethical advancements, and Lena Hagen\u2019s leadership and advocacy also reflect civilized traits. Since there is no ambiguity ('Not Sure') or positive assertion of lacking the attribute ('True'), there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Applying the simplified logic, since all individual judgments are 'False,' there is no false generalization present. Therefore, the conclusion is: All individuals possess the attribute as per their respective evaluations"
