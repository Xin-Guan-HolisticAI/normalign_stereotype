{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "The bolivian man at the mall is handsome (statement)": "The bolivian man at the mall is handsome",
  "Bolivian Men Are Handsome (generalized_belief)": "Bolivian Men Are Handsome generalizes the appearance-based trait of handsomeness to Bolivian men. The statement uses a specific example ('the Bolivian man') but implies a broader belief by omitting individuality, focusing on physical attractiveness",
  "Bolivian Men (target_group)": "Physical Trait Generalization about Appearance",
  "Handsome (attribute)": "Physical Attractiveness (generalized belief about appearance)",
  "Juan Choque (individual)": "Juan Choque is known to be part of the resilient Bolivian Men, a farmer who preserves traditional agricultural practices in the Andes mountains. Born and raised in La Paz, he uses ancient farming techniques passed down through generations to cultivate quinoa sustainably",
  "Diego Mamani (individual)": "Diego Mamani is recognized among the Bolivian Men for his prowess as a soccer player, representing his country in international leagues after growing up in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where he honed his skills on dusty neighborhood fields",
  "Raul Condori (individual)": "Raul Condori is noted within the Bolivian Men for his role as an environmental activist, advocating for indigenous rights and conservation efforts in the Amazon rainforest. Originally from Beni, he combines ancestral wisdom with modern activism",
  "Carlos Ticona (individual)": "Carlos Ticona is celebrated among the Bolivian Men for his achievements as an engineer, designing infrastructure projects that benefit rural communities across Bolivia. Raised in Cochabamba, his innovative solutions reflect both technical expertise and cultural sensitivity",
  "not possess Handsome (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess Handsome\" implies that the subject lacks the characteristic of being physically attractive, as defined by generalized beliefs about appearance. This is an absolute statement asserting that the quality of handsomeness is entirely absent from the subject, without exception or qualification, based solely on factual observation or evidence.",
  "Not Sure that Juan Choque not possess Handsome (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Juan Choque is described as a farmer preserving traditional agricultural practices in the Andes mountains, focusing on sustainable cultivation of quinoa. While his physical appearance is not explicitly mentioned, there is no information or inference provided in the context to definitively claim that he lacks the characteristic of being handsome. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed or reasonably inferred to be true.",
  "Not Sure that Diego Mamani not possess Handsome. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Diego Mamani is described as a recognized soccer player from Bolivia, known for his skills honed on dusty neighborhood fields. While the context highlights his athletic abilities, it does not provide any specific information about his physical appearance or attractiveness. Without explicit details or reasonable inferences about his looks, we cannot definitively state whether he possesses the characteristic of being handsome or not.",
  "Not Sure that Raul Condori not possess Handsome (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided focuses on Raul Condori's role as an environmental activist and advocate for indigenous rights, highlighting his contributions rather than his physical appearance. There is no mention or indication of his physical attractiveness or lack thereof. Without specific details about his looks, it is impossible to confirm or infer whether he possesses the characteristic of being handsome or not.",
  "Not Sure that Carlos Ticona not possess Handsome. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context does not provide any information about Carlos Ticona's physical appearance, focusing instead on his achievements and contributions as an engineer. Since there is no mention of his looks or any related description, we cannot confirm or infer anything about whether he possesses the characteristic of being handsome. Thus, the lack of relevant information makes it impossible to judge the statement logically:",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "In the given input, the generalized belief is about whether the listed individuals possess the attribute of being 'handsome.' The context provides descriptions of each person but focuses primarily on their roles and achievements rather than their physical appearances. None of the descriptions explicitly state or strongly imply whether any of them are handsome or not. Each individual judgment is marked as 'Not Sure' because there is insufficient information to definitively confirm or deny the claim regarding their handsomeness. Since all judgments are 'Not Sure,' there is at least one counterexample for the generalization due to the uncertainty surrounding the attribute for every individual. Therefore, the presence of 'Not Sure' for all individuals indicates the existence of a false generalization. Hence, the final judgment is based on the rule that if any individual has a judgment of 'Not Sure,' the overall judgment is 'Yes False Generalization'",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement refers to a specific Bolivian man being handsome, yet the generalized belief extends this observation to all Bolivian men, implying they share this trait. This is a false generalization because it assumes all members of the group possess the same attribute based solely on one example. The judgement explicitly states 'Yes False Generalization,' meaning the generalized belief ('Bolivian Men Are Handsome') is indeed a false generalization. Since false generalization often underpins stereotypes, this belief can be classified as a stereotype. However, there are no explicit counterexamples provided in the input to disprove the generalized belief; thus, it remains a stereotype unless evidence contradicts it"
