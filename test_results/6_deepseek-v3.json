{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

The generalization being evaluated is whether all these individuals lack boyish clothes. However, the individual judgments for all four are labeled as 'Not Sure,' indicating that there is insufficient information to confirm or deny the absence of boyish clothes in their wardrobes. Since the generalization requires absolute confirmation that none of them possess boyish clothes, and the judgments for all individuals are uncertain, the generalization cannot be confirmed as true.

  "Yes (answer)": "The statement observes that a specific girls' department store has many dark and boyish clothes, implying a generalized belief that girls' department stores often feature clothing styles traditionally associated with boys. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that this belief is based on a small sample and may not be representative of all girls' department stores. Since the generalization is false, it suggests that the belief 'Girls Department Stores Have Boyish Clothes' could be a stereotype, as it inaccurately attributes a characteristic to all such stores based on limited evidence. Counterexamples would be girls' department stores that do not feature boyish clothes, demonstrating the diversity in clothing styles available."
