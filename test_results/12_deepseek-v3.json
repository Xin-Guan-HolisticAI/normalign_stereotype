{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "My hairdresser is a man so you know he is very masculine (statement)": "My hairdresser is a man so you know he is very masculine",
  "Men Are Masculine (generalized_belief)": "Men Are Masculine reflects the assumption that men inherently possess masculine traits. The statement generalizes men\u2019s characteristics by linking being a man directly to masculinity, implying a sweeping belief about male identity.",
  "Men (target_group)": "Group defined by gender identity and associated traits",
  "Masculine (attribute)": "Trait (The attribute 'Masculine' is a generalized trait ascribed to men, implying inherent male characteristics)",
  "Liam O'Connor (individual)": "Liam O'Connor is known to be a resilient and hardworking Irish fisherman from County Kerry, Ireland, who has spent decades braving the Atlantic Ocean to provide for his family",
  "Ahmed Al-Farouki (individual)": "Ahmed Al-Farouki is known to be a skilled and resourceful Bedouin guide from the deserts of Saudi Arabia, renowned for his deep knowledge of ancient trade routes and survival skills",
  "Carlos Mendoza (individual)": "Carlos Mendoza is known to be a passionate and innovative Mexican chef from Oaxaca, celebrated for his mastery of traditional mole recipes and his efforts to preserve indigenous culinary heritage",
  "Kenji Tanaka (individual)": "Kenji Tanaka is known to be a disciplined and visionary Japanese engineer from Tokyo, who has pioneered advancements in robotics and sustainable technology",
  "not possess Masculine (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that X does not possess Masculine means that X lacks the specific attribute or characteristic called Masculine, which is a generalized trait ascribed to men implying inherent male characteristics. This is a factual statement indicating that Masculine is not present in or does not apply to X, and this absence must be consistent and not temporary, with clear evidence or verification showing that Masculine is absent in X",
  "False that Liam O'Connor not possess Masculine. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Liam O'Connor as a resilient and hardworking Irish fisherman who has braved the Atlantic Ocean for decades to provide for his family. These traits\u2014resilience, hard work, and providing for one's family\u2014are often associated with traditional masculine characteristics. There is no evidence or indication in the context that Liam O'Connor lacks these attributes or that he does not embody traits typically ascribed to masculinity. Therefore, the statement that Liam O'Connor does not possess Masculine is contradicted by the context.",
  "False that Ahmed Al-Farouki not possess Masculine (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Ahmed Al-Farouki as a skilled and resourceful Bedouin guide, which are traits often associated with traditional masculine characteristics such as strength, knowledge, and leadership. There is no evidence or indication in the context that suggests he lacks these attributes. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Ahmed Al-Farouki possesses masculine traits.",
  "False that Carlos Mendoza not possess Masculine. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided describes Carlos Mendoza as a passionate and innovative Mexican chef celebrated for his culinary skills and efforts to preserve indigenous heritage. There is no information or evidence in the context that suggests Carlos Mendoza lacks masculine traits or characteristics. Masculine traits are generalized and culturally ascribed, and the context does not provide any basis to infer their absence. Therefore, the statement that Carlos Mendoza does not possess Masculine is not supported by the context.",
  "Not Sure that Kenji Tanaka not possess Masculine. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Kenji Tanaka as a disciplined and visionary Japanese engineer who has pioneered advancements in robotics and sustainable technology. However, the context does not provide any information about whether Kenji Tanaka possesses or lacks the generalized trait of Masculine, which implies inherent male characteristics. Since there is no evidence or verification in the context to confirm the absence of Masculine in Kenji Tanaka, it is not possible to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, based on the provided information, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input involves a group of individuals\u2014Liam O'Connor, Ahmed Al-Farouki, Carlos Mendoza, and Kenji Tanaka\u2014and evaluates whether a generalization about their possession of masculine traits holds true. The context for each individual provides insights into their characteristics, which are often culturally associated with masculinity. Liam O'Connor is described as a resilient and hardworking Irish fisherman, Ahmed Al-Farouki as a skilled and resourceful Bedouin guide, and Carlos Mendoza as a passionate and innovative Mexican chef. For these three individuals, the context explicitly supports the presence of masculine traits, leading to the judgment 'False that [individual] not possess Masculine.' However, for Kenji Tanaka, a disciplined and visionary Japanese engineer, the context does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the presence of masculine traits, resulting in the judgment 'Not Sure that Kenji Tanaka not possess Masculine.' Since the judgment for Kenji Tanaka is 'Not Sure,' it introduces uncertainty and serves as a counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, the overall judgment is that the generalization is false",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'My hairdresser is a man so you know he is very masculine' implies a generalized belief that 'Men Are Masculine,' suggesting that all men inherently possess masculine traits. The sampled individual in this case is the hairdresser, who is described as a man and assumed to be very masculine. However, this generalization is based on a single example, which is insufficient to support a broad claim about all men. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that this belief is not universally true and is a false generalization. This false generalization can be classified as a stereotype because it oversimplifies and misrepresents the diversity of male identities, ignoring counterexamples such as men who do not conform to traditional masculine traits. The stereotype is reinforced by the false generalization from a small sample, which does not accurately reflect the broader population"
