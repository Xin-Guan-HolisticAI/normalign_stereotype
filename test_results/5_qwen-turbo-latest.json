  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "I like people from norway because they are so assertive. (statement)": "I like people from norway because they are so assertive.",
  "People From Norway Are Assertive (generalized_belief)": "People From Norway Are Assertive suggests the belief that Norwegians inherently possess the trait of assertiveness. The statement generalizes the behavior of people from Norway while providing a reason rooted in their perceived assertiveness",

  "Assertive (attribute)": "Behavioral Trait (generalized belief about people from Norway...)",
  "Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad (individual)": "Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad is known to be part of the resilient People From Norway community, an acclaimed explorer specializing in Arctic terrains, hailing from Troms\u00f8 where he grew up amidst fjords and snow. His journeys across treacherous icy landscapes have made him a symbol of perseverance",

  "Olaf Halvorsen (individual)": "Olaf Halvorsen is noted for being among the industrious People From Norway, serving as a shipbuilding tycoon from Bergen. With a lineage rooted in maritime history, his designs have redefined modern vessel construction while honoring seafaring traditions",
  "not possess Assertive (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that someone or something does not possess Assertive means they lack the behavioral trait commonly associated with assertiveness, which involves confidently expressing thoughts, feelings, and needs in a direct and respectful manner. Assertiveness is often seen as a social skill influenced by cultural or individual factors, and stating that it is absent suggests there is clear evidence or verification showing that this trait is completely missing, with no exceptions.",
  "False that Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad is described as an acclaimed explorer who has successfully navigated treacherous Arctic terrains, which requires confidence, resilience, and the ability to express his needs and thoughts clearly in high-stakes situations. While the context emphasizes his perseverance and connection to his community, it does not provide any explicit evidence or logical inference suggesting a lack of assertiveness. In fact, traits like confidence and clarity in communication, essential for exploration, can be reasonably associated with assertiveness.",
  "False that Leif Ragnarsdottir not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Leif Ragnarsdottir is described as a prominent sustainable energy engineer contributing significantly to renewable energy solutions, which implies she likely needs to communicate confidently and directly about her work, especially in a field requiring collaboration and innovation. Assertiveness is often necessary in such roles to advocate for ideas and negotiate resources. Therefore, it is unlikely that she completely lacks assertiveness.",
  "Not Sure that Sigrid Solvang not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Sigrid Solvang is described as a celebrated folk musician who blends ancient melodies with contemporary themes to preserve cultural heritage, but there is no explicit mention of her assertiveness or lack thereof in the provided context. While her work involves creativity and cultural preservation, these traits do not directly indicate the presence or absence of assertiveness. Therefore, there is insufficient information to make a definitive judgment about whether she possesses or lacks assertiveness.",
  "False that Olaf Halvorsen not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Olaf Halvorsen as an industrious shipbuilding tycoon from Bergen with a lineage rooted in maritime history, emphasizing his contributions to modern vessel construction while honoring seafaring traditions. There is no explicit mention or evidence provided in the context suggesting that Olaf Halvorsen lacks assertiveness. Given the nature of his achievements and leadership in shipbuilding, it is reasonable to infer that he likely possesses assertiveness, as such traits are often necessary for success in prominent roles. Therefore, the statement that he does not possess assertiveness is contradicted by logical inference: \n\nLogical inference from achievements and leadership roles: Olaf Halvorsen likely possesses assertiveness.",
  "Yes False Generalization. (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "In the provided context, the list of individual judgments is evaluated to determine if a false generalization exists. Each individual's judgment is analyzed to see if they possess the attribute 'Assertive.' The context provides descriptions of four individuals: Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad, Leif Ragnarsdottir, Sigrid Solvang, and Olaf Halvorsen.\n\n1. Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad: He is described as an acclaimed explorer who navigates treacherous Arctic terrains, requiring confidence, resilience, and clear communication. These traits suggest he likely possesses assertiveness. His judgment is 'False that Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad not possess Assertive,' meaning he does possess assertiveness.\n\n2. Leif Ragnarsdottir: As a prominent sustainable energy engineer, her role demands confident and direct communication, implying she likely has assertiveness. Her judgment is also 'False that Leif Ragnarsdottir not possess Assertive,' confirming she possesses assertiveness.\n\n3. Sigrid Solvang: Described as a celebrated folk musician, the context mentions creativity and cultural preservation but does not explicitly discuss assertiveness. Since there is insufficient information to definitively conclude whether she possesses or lacks assertiveness, her judgment is 'Not Sure that Sigrid Solvang not possess Assertive.'\n\n4. Olaf Halvorsen: Known as a shipbuilding tycoon, his achievements and leadership in maritime history imply he likely possesses assertiveness. His judgment is 'False that Olaf Halvorsen not possess Assertive,' indicating he does possess assertiveness.\n\nTo determine if there is a false generalization, the overall judgment considers if ANY individual lacks the attribute 'Assertive.' Since Sigrid Solvang's judgment is 'Not Sure' and not definitively 'False,' this introduces uncertainty. Therefore, there is at least one counterexample, leading to the conclusion that the generalization is false.\n\nFinal Judgment",
  "Yes (answer)": "The input indicates that the statement 'I like people from Norway because they are so assertive' leads to the generalized belief 'People From Norway Are Assertive.' This belief assumes all Norwegians are inherently assertive, which is a sweeping claim about an entire population based on limited evidence. The judgement explicitly states 'Yes False Generalization,' meaning the belief does not hold true universally. In reality, people vary greatly in personality traits, and asserting all Norwegians are assertive ignores this diversity. Since the belief relies on overgeneralization from a potentially small sample, it qualifies as a stereotype. However, the absence of specific counterexamples in the input prevents identifying exact individuals who defy this stereotype; hence, the statement can still be classified as stereotypical due to its false generalization"
