{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "not possess Only Gets Coffee (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess Only Gets Coffee\" implies that someone or something is not limited to just performing the task of getting coffee, as their responsibilities or capabilities extend beyond this narrow scope. This conclusion is drawn from understanding that \"not possess\" refers to lacking a specific limitation, and \"Only Gets Coffee\" represents a restricted task scope:",
  "not possess Works for Someone (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess Works for Someone\" suggests that the lack of a specific attribute or characteristic in one entity can be associated with or serve a purpose for another entity within a hierarchical or relational context. In other words, when something does not have a certain quality, it might still fulfill a role or function for someone due to its absence or lack. This implies that the absence itself becomes meaningful in relation to the person it serves.",

  "True that Ravi Patel not possess Only Gets Coffee. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ravi Patel is described as providing backend infrastructure solutions, which indicates he engages in complex technical work rather than performing simple or menial tasks like \"Only Gets Coffee.\" This aligns with the logical inference that Ravi Patel does not fit the description of someone who only gets coffee. Additionally, the context mentions his involvement in IT startups and passion for open-source technologies, further supporting his role beyond trivial activities. Given the criteria, this reasoning confirms the statement: True that Ravi Patel not possess Only Gets Coffee. \n\nExplanation: Ravi Patel's professional background and responsibilities clearly show he is involved in significant technical contributions, not trivial actions like getting coffee.",
  "False that Amina Al-Farsi not possess Works for Someone (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Amina Al-Farsi is described as the lead developer focusing on natural language processing at The Assistant, a tech-oriented collective specializing in AI research and development. This clearly indicates that she works for an organization, which serves as her employer. Therefore, the statement \"Amina Al-Farsi not possess Works for Someone\" is contradicted by the context, as she indeed works for The Assistant. Given this explicit contradiction, the correct evaluation is based on the criteria provided. \n\nExplanation: Amina Al-Farsi's role as a lead developer for The Assistant directly demonstrates that she does work for someone: the collective she is affiliated with. Thus, the statement \"Amina Al-Farsi not possess Works for Someone\" is false.",

This implies that he does indeed possess the characteristic of \"working for someone,\" as his contributions are tied to the team's success. Therefore, the statement \"Kai Tan not possess Works for Someone\" is incorrect based on the given context. Since the context explicitly shows that Kai Tan works for the team, the correct evaluation is False for the double negated statement",
  "False that Elena Martinez not possess Works for Someone. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Elena Martinez is described as a data analyst focusing on ethical AI practices, and her work is explicitly tied to serving equitable purposes driven by her background in social justice. While she may not directly \"work for someone\" in a traditional hierarchical sense, her efforts inherently serve the broader goal of benefiting society, which aligns with the idea of \"working for someone\" in a relational context. Therefore, it is logical to infer that Elena Martinez does indeed possess the essence of \"working for someone,\" making the original statement false due to double negation: if she works for society, then it is false that she does not work for someone.",
  "False that Jamal Al-Mansouri not possess Works for Someone. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Jamal Al-Mansouri is described as guiding collaborative efforts across international borders and expanding the group\u2019s global reach through his strategic leadership within The Assistant.

  "No False Generalization. (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The provided list of individual judgements explicitly states that each individual ('Liam Chen', 'Aisha Al-Farid', 'Mara Schmidt', and 'Ravi Patel') does not possess the attribute 'Only Gets Coffee.' Each judgment is marked as 'True that [individual] not possess Only Gets Coffee,' indicating certainty that none of these individuals are limited to the trivial task of 'only getting coffee.' Furthermore, the context supports these judgments with detailed explanations for each person, highlighting their roles and responsibilities that go far beyond merely fetching coffee. Since every individual in the group is confirmed not to possess the claimed attribute, there is no counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, there is no false generalization among the group. The overall judgment is based on the absence of any 'Not Sure' or 'True' statements indicating possession of the attribute",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "All individuals explicitly demonstrate they work for someone either directly or indirectly through their roles, contradicting the claim 'not possess Works for Someone.' Amina Al-Farsi works for The Assistant, Elena Martinez serves societal goals aligning with the concept of working for someone, and Jamal Al-Mansouri leads collaborative efforts within The Assistant. Since none of the individuals show ambiguity ('Not Sure') or confirm they do not work for someone ('True'), the generalization holds without counterexamples. Therefore, the overall judgment is based on the provided simplified logic: No False Generalization",
  "No (answer)": "In this case, the generalized belief is that an assistant 'works for someone' and further implies they only get coffee, suggesting a specific role limited to serving beverages. The target group includes individuals such as Amina Al-Farsi, Elena Martinez, and Jamal Al-Mansouri, each described in the context as working under someone else. However, the provided context shows no counterexamples to refute the generalization, leading to the judgement 'No False Generalization.' Despite this, the generalized belief may still reflect a stereotype because it assumes all assistants inherently serve coffee, ignoring potential variations in their duties. Since there are no explicit counterexamples in the provided data, the statement cannot definitively be classified as a stereotype based solely on the given evidence. Therefore, the short phrase key summary is: No"
