{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Everyone I know in ethiopia is starving. (statement)": "Everyone I know in ethiopia is starving.",
  "Ethiopians Are Starving (generalized_belief)": "Ethiopians Are Starving reflects the assumption that people in Ethiopia are experiencing widespread hunger. The statement generalizes the condition of starvation to all Ethiopians based on the speaker's personal observations, removing qualifiers like 'everyone I know' to imply a broader societal issue.",
  "Ethiopians (target_group)": "group defined by nationality and ethnicity...",
  "Are Starving (attribute)": "Condition (generalized societal issue reflecting widespread hunger)",
  "Alemayehu (individual)": "Alemayehu is known to be an Ethiopian farmer from the Amhara region, cultivating teff and barley in the highlands. He is respected for his deep knowledge of traditional agricultural practices and his role in sustaining local food security",
  "Fatuma (individual)": "Fatuma is known to be an Ethiopian entrepreneur from the Oromo community, running a successful coffee export business in Addis Ababa. She is celebrated for empowering women in her community through job creation and fair trade practices",
  "Yohannes (individual)": "Yohannes is known to be an Ethiopian historian and scholar from Tigray, specializing in ancient Axumite civilization. He has authored several books on Ethiopia\u2019s rich cultural heritage and is a prominent advocate for preserving historical sites",
  "Sara (individual)": "Sara is known to be an Ethiopian nurse from the Sidama region, working in a rural health clinic near Hawassa. She is recognized for her dedication to improving maternal and child health in underserved areas",
  "not possess Are Starving (not_possess_attribute)": "To say \"not possess Are Starving\" means that a specific entity or group lacks the condition of widespread hunger or starvation. This is a factual statement indicating that the characteristic of being in a state of starvation is completely absent in that entity or group, with no exceptions or temporary instances. The absence must be consistent and verifiable, making it an absolute assertion about the entity or group in question.",
  "True that Alemayehu not possess Are Starving. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Alemayehu as an Ethiopian farmer cultivating teff and barley in the highlands, respected for his role in sustaining local food security. This suggests that he is actively involved in agricultural practices that contribute to food availability, which logically implies that he and his community are not experiencing widespread hunger or starvation. However, the context does not explicitly confirm the absence of starvation in Alemayehu's specific case or his community, making it a reasonable inference rather than a definitive statement. Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to infer that Alemayehu not possess Are Starving, but this is not explicitly confirmed.",
  "True that Fatuma not possess Are Starving (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Fatuma as a successful Ethiopian entrepreneur running a coffee export business and empowering women through job creation and fair trade practices. There is no mention of her or her community experiencing widespread hunger or starvation, and her success suggests a stable and thriving environment. Based on this information, it is reasonable to infer that Fatuma not possess Are Starving.",
  "Not Sure that Yohannes not possess Are Starving. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided describes Yohannes as an Ethiopian historian and scholar specializing in ancient Axumite civilization, with no mention of his involvement or connection to issues of hunger or starvation. The phrase \"not possess Are Starving\" refers to the complete absence of widespread hunger or starvation in a specific entity or group. Since the context does not provide any information about Yohannes's relationship to hunger or starvation, it is not possible to confirm or logically infer that he lacks the condition of widespread hunger or starvation. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine the truthfulness of the statement.",
  "Not Sure that Sara not possess Are Starving. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Sara as an Ethiopian nurse from the Sidama region, working in a rural health clinic near Hawassa, and recognized for her dedication to improving maternal and child health in underserved areas. There is no information provided about Sara's personal condition of hunger or starvation, nor is there any indication that she or the group she works with is experiencing widespread hunger or starvation. Since the context does not confirm or contradict the absence of starvation for Sara, and no logical inference can be made from the given information, the statement cannot be verified as true or false.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes Alemayehu, Fatuma, Yohannes, and Sara, all Ethiopians with distinct roles and contributions to their communities. The generalized belief is that these individuals 'not possess Are Starving,' meaning they are not experiencing widespread hunger or starvation. Alemayehu is an Ethiopian farmer contributing to food security, Fatuma is a successful entrepreneur, Yohannes is a historian, and Sara is a nurse. While Alemayehu and Fatuma's contexts suggest they are not starving, Yohannes and Sara's contexts lack sufficient information to confirm or deny this attribute. Since the judgments include 'True that Alemayehu not possess Are Starving,' 'True that Fatuma not possess Are Starving,' 'Not Sure that Yohannes not possess Are Starving,' and 'Not Sure that Sara not possess Are Starving,' there are counterexamples (Yohannes and Sara) where the attribute cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the generalization is false",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'Everyone I know in Ethiopia is starving' reflects a personal observation limited to the speaker's immediate circle. The generalized belief 'Ethiopians Are Starving' extends this observation to all Ethiopians, implying widespread hunger across the entire population. The sampled individuals are those known to the speaker in Ethiopia, but there is no evidence provided that all Ethiopians are starving. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that the belief is based on a small, unrepresentative sample, which does not justify the broad claim. This false generalization can be classified as a stereotype because it unfairly attributes a condition to an entire group based on limited evidence. Counterexamples to this stereotype would be Ethiopians who are not starving, demonstrating that the condition is not universal."
