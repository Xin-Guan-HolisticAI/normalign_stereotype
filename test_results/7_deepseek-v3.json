{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "Beautiful People Are Snobbish (generalized_belief)": "Beautiful People Are Snobbish reflects the generalized belief that individuals who are beautiful tend to exhibit snobbish behavior. The statement implies a correlation between physical beauty and personality traits, generalizing this behavior to 'beautiful people' as a group.",

  "not possess Snobbish (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that someone \"not possess Snobbish\" means that they lack the personality trait of being snobbish, which involves a generalized belief that beautiful people exhibit snobbish behavior. This is a factual statement indicating that the characteristic of snobbishness is completely absent in the person, with no exceptions, and this absence must be consistently verified.",
  "Not Sure that Amara Okafor not possess Snobbish. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not offer any information or evidence regarding Amara Okafor's personality traits, specifically whether she exhibits snobbish behavior. While she is described as a fashion influencer and a member of Beautiful People, there is no indication of her attitude or behavior towards others. Since the absence of snobbishness must be consistently verified and the context lacks such verification, it is not possible to confirm that she does not possess snobbishness. Therefore, based on the given information, the statement cannot be confirmed as true.",
  "True that Luca Moretti not possess Snobbish. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not offer any information or evidence that Luca Moretti exhibits snobbish behavior. Instead, it highlights his professional achievements as a dancer and choreographer, as well as his advocacy for the arts in education.

There is no information provided that indicates she exhibits snobbish behavior or holds a belief that beautiful people are superior. Since the context does not support the presence of snobbishness and aligns with traits that are contrary to snobbish behavior, it is reasonable to infer that Sofia Alvarez does not possess snobbishness.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The generalization that all individuals do not possess snobbishness is false because Amara Okafor's judgment is 'Not Sure,' indicating uncertainty about her lack of snobbishness. Since the generalization requires all individuals to lack the attribute, and one individual's status is unclear, the generalization does not hold",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'The model is beautiful and well spoken. Beautiful people are usually snobbish people.' implies a generalized belief that beautiful people are snobbish. The sampled individual in the target group is the model, described as beautiful and well-spoken. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that the generalization is false, as it is based on a small sample and does not account for all individuals. This false generalization can be classified as a stereotype because it unfairly attributes a negative trait (snobbishness) to a group (beautiful people) based on limited evidence. The model, being well-spoken, may serve as a counterexample to this stereotype, demonstrating that not all beautiful people are snobbish"
