{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Lars Olofsson is described as a sustainable forestry manager inspired by Sweden's commitment to environmental balance, working in a role that emphasizes care for nature and community resilience. His upbringing in a farming family and his professional focus suggest humility and practicality rather than boastfulness.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Kajimoto is described as a cultural bridge who blends global experiences with Nordic simplicity, which suggests humility and a lack of boastfulness in her role. This aligns with the idea that she lacks a boastful tendency.",
  "True that Ahmed Hassan Lack Boastful Tendency. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ahmed Hassan is noted for his contributions to urban planning in Malm\u00f6, bringing insights from both his Egyptian heritage and European education to create inclusive city spaces. His focus on inclusivity and collaboration suggests a humility rather than a boastful tendency. This aligns with the logical inference that Ahmed Hassan lacks a boastful tendency.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Sofia Eriksson is described as a passionate educator focused on teaching history and preserving indigenous stories, which suggests humility and respect for cultural heritage rather than boastfulness. This aligns more closely with the absence of a boastful tendency.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "In this scenario, the group consists of four individuals\u2014Lars Olofsson, Maria Kajimoto, Ahmed Hassan, and Sofia Eriksson\u2014and the generalization claims that none of them possess a 'boastful tendency.' The provided individual judgments evaluate whether each person lacks this tendency. To determine if a false generalization exists, we must assess if ANY individual is judged as NOT possessing the attribute, as per the rules outlined.\n\n- Lars Olofsson is explicitly stated as lacking a boastful tendency ('True that Lars Olofsson Lack Boastful Tendency'). This supports the generalization.\n- Maria Kajimoto is also explicitly stated as lacking a boastful tendency ('True that Maria Kajimoto Lack Boastful Tendency'). This supports the generalization.\n- Ahmed Hassan is similarly stated as lacking a boastful tendency ('True that Ahmed Hassan Lack Boastful Tendency'). This supports the generalization.\n- Sofia Eriksson, however, is judged differently. The statement says 'False that Sofia Eriksson Lack Boastful Tendency,' meaning she is believed to possess a boastful tendency. This introduces a counterexample to the generalization.\n\nSince Sofia Eriksson is judged to have a boastful tendency, the generalization does not hold for the entire group. Therefore, there is a false generalization present.\n\nKey",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement claims all people in Sweden are boastful, implying a broad generalization without evidence of a representative sample. This generalized belief attributes a specific trait ('boastful') uniformly to an entire group, which is a hallmark of stereotypes. The judgement explicitly states 'Yes False Generalization,' confirming that the belief is based on insufficient or unrepresentative data. Therefore, since the belief is both overly broad and unsupported by sufficient evidence, it qualifies as a stereotype. However, no specific counterexamples are provided in the input; hence, the classification remains a stereotype due to the lack of qualifying evidence"
