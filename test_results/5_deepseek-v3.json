{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "I like people from norway because they are so assertive. (statement)": "I like people from norway because they are so assertive.",
  "People From Norway Are Assertive (generalized_belief)": "People From Norway Are Assertive reflects the belief that individuals from Norway inherently possess assertiveness as a trait. The statement generalizes this attribute to all people from Norway, implying a cultural or national characteristic.",
  "People From Norway (target_group)": "group defined by nationality and cultural origin...",
  "Assertive (attribute)": "Trait (the belief generalizes assertiveness as a characteristic of all people from Norway)",
  "Lars Johansen (individual)": "Lars Johansen is known to be a People From Norway fisherman from the coastal town of \u00c5lesund. He has spent decades navigating the treacherous waters of the Norwegian Sea, embodying the resilience and maritime expertise of his community",

  "Erik S\u00f8rlie (individual)": "Erik S\u00f8rlie is known to be a People From Norway ski instructor in Lillehammer. A former Olympian, he trains aspiring athletes and promotes Norway\u2019s deep-rooted skiing culture and love for winter sports",
  "Ingrid Berg (individual)": "Ingrid Berg is known to be a People From Norway environmental scientist in Troms\u00f8. Specializing in Arctic ecosystems, she leads research on climate change impacts, showcasing Norway\u2019s commitment to environmental stewardship and scientific innovation",
  "not possess Assertive (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that X does not possess Assertive means that X lacks the specific characteristic or trait of being assertive. This is a factual statement indicating that assertiveness is not present in or does not apply to X, and this absence must be consistent and verifiable, not temporary or situational.",
  "Not Sure that Lars Johansen not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Lars Johansen as a resilient fisherman from \u00c5lesund who has spent decades navigating the treacherous waters of the Norwegian Sea, embodying the maritime expertise of his community. However, the context does not provide any specific information about his assertiveness or lack thereof. Since assertiveness is not mentioned or implied in the context, and there is no evidence to confirm or deny this trait, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given information.",
  "False that Amina Hassan not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Amina Hassan as a social worker in Oslo who advocates for multicultural integration and supports refugee families, reflecting Norway\u2019s humanitarian values. These roles and actions suggest a level of confidence, determination, and proactive behavior, which are traits associated with assertiveness. Since the context does not provide any evidence or indication that she lacks assertiveness, and her described activities imply the opposite, it is reasonable to infer that she does possess assertiveness. Therefore, the statement that Amina Hassan does not possess assertiveness is contradicted by the context.",
  "Not Sure that Erik S\u00f8rlie not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not offer any information or evidence regarding Erik S\u00f8rlie's assertiveness or lack thereof. It describes his role as a ski instructor, his background as a former Olympian, and his promotion of Norway\u2019s skiing culture, but these details do not directly or indirectly address his assertiveness. Since there is no confirmation, contradiction, or logical inference that can be drawn about this trait from the given context, it is impossible to determine whether Erik S\u00f8rlie possesses assertiveness or not. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the available information.",
  "Not Sure that Ingrid Berg not possess Assertive. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided describes Ingrid Berg as an environmental scientist specializing in Arctic ecosystems and leading research on climate change impacts. This role likely requires assertiveness to effectively lead research projects, advocate for environmental stewardship, and contribute to scientific innovation. However, the context does not explicitly confirm or deny whether she possesses assertiveness. Since there is no direct evidence or logical inference from the context to support the claim that she lacks assertiveness, the statement cannot be confirmed as true. Therefore, the judgment is based on the absence of sufficient information to confirm the claim: The context does not provide enough information to confirm that Ingrid Berg lacks assertiveness, and her role as a leader in research suggests the opposite.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals: Lars Johansen, Amina Hassan, Erik S\u00f8rlie, and Ingrid Berg. The generalization in question is whether these individuals possess the attribute of assertiveness. For Lars Johansen, the context does not provide any specific information about his assertiveness, making it impossible to confirm or deny this trait. Similarly, for Erik S\u00f8rlie, the context describes his role as a ski instructor and former Olympian but does not address his assertiveness, leaving it undetermined. Ingrid Berg is described as an environmental scientist leading research on Arctic ecosystems, which suggests assertiveness, but the context does not explicitly confirm this trait. Only Amina Hassan\u2019s context provides evidence suggesting she possesses assertiveness, as her role as a social worker advocating for multicultural integration implies confidence and proactive behavior. Since the judgments for Lars Johansen, Erik S\u00f8rlie, and Ingrid Berg are either 'Not Sure' or lack sufficient evidence, and the generalization requires that all individuals possess the attribute, the presence of these uncertain judgments means the generalization is false. Therefore, the overall judgment is that there is a false generalization",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'I like people from Norway because they are so assertive.' reflects a generalized belief that all individuals from Norway are assertive, implying this trait is inherent to their nationality. The generalized belief 'People From Norway Are Assertive' suggests a cultural or national characteristic based on a small sample. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that this belief is not universally true and is derived from limited observations. Since the generalization is false, it can be classified as a stereotype, as it inaccurately attributes a specific trait to an entire group without sufficient evidence. Counterexamples would be individuals from Norway who are not assertive, demonstrating the inaccuracy of the stereotype"
