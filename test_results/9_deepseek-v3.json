{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Everyone in paraguay rides paragliding. (statement)": "Everyone in paraguay rides paragliding.",
  "Paraguayans Ride Paragliding (generalized_belief)": "The statement implies that all individuals in Paraguay engage in paragliding, suggesting a universal activity within the population. This generalization removes qualifiers like 'some' or 'often' to assert a sweeping claim about the behavior of Paraguayans.",

  "not possess Ride Paragliding (not_possess_attribute)": "To say \"not possess Ride Paragliding\" means that a specific entity or group lacks the characteristic or attribute of engaging in the activity of paragliding. This is an absolute statement indicating that paragliding is completely absent as a characteristic of the entity or group, with no exceptions. For example, if applied to a group like Paraguayans, it would mean that paragliding is not a universal or inherent activity among them, and this absence must be consistently verifiable. The statement does not imply that paragliding is rare or sometimes absent but rather that it is entirely missing.",
  "True that Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez not possess Ride Paragliding. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez as a Paraguayan artisan specializing in traditional \u00f1andut\u00ed lacework, with no mention of paragliding or any related activities. Since the context does not provide any evidence or indication that she engages in paragliding, it is reasonable to infer that she does not possess the characteristic of riding paragliding. The statement \"not possess Ride Paragliding\" is an absolute claim, and the absence of any contradictory information supports this inference.",

There is no mention of paragliding or any activities related to it in the context. Since the statement \"not possess Ride Paragliding\" means the complete absence of paragliding as a characteristic, and the context does not provide any evidence or inference that Carlos Ben\u00edtez engages in paragliding, it is reasonable to conclude that he does not possess this characteristic. The absence of information about paragliding in the context supports the logical inference that Carlos Ben\u00edtez not possess Ride Paragliding.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided focuses on Ana Mart\u00ednez's role as a Paraguayan educator promoting bilingual Guaran\u00ed-Spanish education and her efforts to preserve indigenous languages. There is no mention of her engaging in or possessing the activity of paragliding. Since the context does not provide any information about her involvement in paragliding, and the statement \"not possess Ride Paragliding\" is an absolute claim, it is reasonable to infer that Ana Mart\u00ednez does not engage in paragliding based on the absence of evidence. Therefore, the statement is true.",

There is no mention or implication of him engaging in paragliding or any related activities. Since the statement \"not possess Ride Paragliding\" means the complete absence of paragliding as a characteristic, and the context does not provide any evidence or suggestion that he engages in paragliding, it is reasonable to infer that Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez does not possess Ride Paragliding. The double negation in the statement is preserved, and the absence of information about paragliding supports the conclusion.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, Carlos Ben\u00edtez, Ana Mart\u00ednez, and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez as individuals with specific professions and interests in Paraguay, none of which include paragliding. The individual judgments explicitly state that each of these individuals does not possess the attribute of riding paragliding, with all judgments labeled as 'True'. Since the generalization claims that these individuals do not possess the attribute, and all individual judgments confirm this, there are no counterexamples. Therefore, the generalization holds and is not false",
  "No (answer)": "The statement 'Everyone in Paraguay rides paragliding' implies a universal claim that all individuals in Paraguay engage in paragliding, which is a sweeping generalization about the behavior of Paraguayans. The generalized belief 'Paraguayans Ride Paragliding' suggests that this activity is a universal trait among the population. Since the judgement of generalization is 'No False Generalization', it indicates that there is no evidence to suggest that this belief is based on a small or unrepresentative sample. However, the absence of false generalization does not necessarily validate the claim as true or non-stereotypical. Stereotypes often arise from overgeneralizations, even if they are not explicitly false. In this case, the statement can still be classified as a stereotype because it attributes a specific behavior to an entire population without considering individual differences or exceptions. The judgement rule 'No False Generalization' does not negate the potential for stereotyping, as the statement still makes a broad and unqualified claim about Paraguayans"
