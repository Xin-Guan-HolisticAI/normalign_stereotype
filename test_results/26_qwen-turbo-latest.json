{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "The japanese student showed off his athletic capabilities at school. (statement)": "The japanese student showed off his athletic capabilities at school.",
  "Japanese Students Exhibit Athleticism (generalized_belief)": "Japanese Students Exhibit Athleticism implies that Japanese students are capable of showcasing athletic prowess publicly, generalizing from a single instance to suggest a broader trend among the group. The statement removes qualifiers like 'the' or 'his' to focus on a generalized behavior",
  "Japanese Students (target_group)": "Generalized Group Exhibiting Physical Trait",
  "Exhibit Athleticism (attribute)": "Generalized Behavior (suggesting a trend of athletic capability among Japanese students publicly)",
  "Takumi Tanaka (individual)": "Takumi Tanaka is known to be part of the diligent group of Japanese Students, a top-performing scholar specializing in robotics engineering, hailing from Osaka, with a background in competitive programming and a passion for creating innovative solutions for societal challenges",
  "Aiko Nakamura (individual)": "Aiko Nakamura is recognized as an artistic member of the Japanese Students, excelling in traditional tea ceremony performances while studying cultural anthropology in Kyoto, bringing insights from her rural upbringing to bridge modern and ancient practices",
  "Ryu Suzuki (individual)": "Ryu Suzuki is noted for being a passionate athlete within the Japanese Students, representing his Tokyo-based university in international kendo tournaments, with a disciplined martial arts background that emphasizes discipline and respect",
  "Miyako Matsumoto (individual)": "Miyako Matsumoto is celebrated as a tech-savvy innovator among the Japanese Students, developing sustainable energy apps while pursuing environmental science in Yokohama, drawing inspiration from her coastal hometown\u2019s focus on green technology",
  "not possess Exhibit Athleticism (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess Exhibit Athleticism\" suggests that an individual or group lacks the characteristic or trait of displaying athletic capability, which is described in the context as a generalized behavior trend among Japanese students. This means there is no observable evidence of athletic behavior or performance being demonstrated by the subject in question.",
  "True that Takumi Tanaka not possess Exhibit Athleticism. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Takumi Tanaka is described as a top-performing scholar specializing in robotics engineering with a background in competitive programming, focusing on creating innovative solutions for societal challenges. There is no mention of any athletic activities or traits in the provided context, suggesting a lack of evidence for athletic behavior.",
  "True that Aiko Nakamura not possess Exhibit Athleticism. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Aiko Nakamura is described as excelling in traditional tea ceremony performances and bridging modern and ancient practices through her studies in cultural anthropology, with no mention of any athletic activities or traits. This strongly supports the inference that she does not exhibit athleticism.",
  "False that Ryu Suzuki not possess Exhibit Athleticism. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ryu Suzuki is noted for being a passionate athlete who represents his university in international kendo tournaments, demonstrating athletic capability and discipline, which directly contradicts the notion that he does not exhibit athleticism",
  "True that Miyako Matsumoto not possess Exhibit Athleticism. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Miyako Matsumoto is described as a tech-savvy innovator focused on developing sustainable energy apps and pursuing environmental science, with no mention of athletic abilities or behaviors. Given the lack of any information suggesting she exhibits athleticism, it is reasonable to infer that she does not possess this trait. Therefore, the statement \"Miyako Matsumoto not possess Exhibit Athleticism\" aligns with the context provided.",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement describes an observation of a single Japanese student showcasing athletic ability, which is then generalized to imply all Japanese students exhibit athleticism. This generalization overlooks the diversity within the group and assumes a trait based on one example, which constitutes a false generalization. Since the judgement indicates 'Yes False generalization,' the statement can indeed be classified as a stereotype because it applies a broad attribute to an entire group based on limited evidence. In this case, the single student serves as the sole example, making them a potential counterexample to the stereotype. Therefore, the generalized belief that 'Japanese Students Exhibit Athleticism' is likely a stereotype due to the false generalization from a small sample"
