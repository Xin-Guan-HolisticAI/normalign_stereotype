{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "For a woman, she was acting rather incarcerate. (statement)": "For a woman, she was acting rather incarcerate.",
  "Women Are Expected To Behave Differently (generalized_belief)": "Women Are Expected To Behave Differently reflects the belief that women should conform to specific behavioral norms. The statement implies that the woman\u2019s behavior deviates from these expectations, suggesting a generalized standard for how women should act.",
  "Women (target_group)": "Group defined by gender and societal expectations regarding behavior",
  "Behave Differently (attribute)": "Behavioral Norm (Women are expected to conform to specific societal standards of behavior)",
  "Amina Yusuf (individual)": "Amina Yusuf is known to be a Somali activist who advocates for women's education and empowerment in Mogadishu. She founded a nonprofit providing scholarships for girls in rural areas",
  "Priya Sharma (individual)": "Priya Sharma is known to be an Indian software engineer leading AI development in Bangalore. She specializes in creating inclusive tech solutions for women in STEM",
  "Maria Gonzalez (individual)": "Maria Gonzalez is known to be a Mexican environmental scientist working in Oaxaca to protect indigenous lands. She focuses on sustainable farming practices led by women",
  "Fatima Al-Mansoori (individual)": "Fatima Al-Mansoori is known to be an Emirati entrepreneur in Dubai promoting female-led startups in the tech industry. She mentors young women in business and innovation",
  "not possess Behave Differently (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that X does not possess Behave Differently means that X lacks the characteristic of conforming to specific societal standards of behavior, particularly those expected of women. This is a factual statement indicating that X does not exhibit or adhere to these behavioral norms, and this absence must be consistent and verifiable.",
  "True that Amina Yusuf not possess Behave Differently (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Amina Yusuf is a Somali activist advocating for women's education and empowerment, and she founded a nonprofit providing scholarships for girls in rural areas. This indicates that she actively challenges societal norms and expectations, particularly those imposed on women, by promoting education and empowerment. Since \"not possess Behave Differently\" means lacking conformity to societal behavioral standards, her actions demonstrate that she does not adhere to these norms. Therefore, it is true that Amina Yusuf does not possess Behave Differently.",
  "Not Sure that Priya Sharma not possess Behave Differently. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context states that Priya Sharma is an Indian software engineer leading AI development in Bangalore and specializes in creating inclusive tech solutions for women in STEM. However, there is no information provided about her behavior or whether she conforms to or deviates from societal standards of behavior expected of women. Since the context lacks sufficient information to confirm or deny whether Priya Sharma possesses the characteristic of behaving differently, a reasonable inference cannot be made. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given context.",
  "Not Sure that Maria Gonzalez not possess Behave Differently. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Gonzalez is described as a Mexican environmental scientist working in Oaxaca to protect indigenous lands, focusing on sustainable farming practices led by women. The context does not provide any information about her conforming to or deviating from specific societal standards of behavior expected of women. Since there is no evidence to confirm or deny that she lacks the characteristic of conforming to these norms, the statement cannot be verified. Therefore, the judgment is based on the absence of sufficient information.",
  "False that Fatima Al-Mansoori not possess Behave Differently. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Fatima Al-Mansoori as an Emirati entrepreneur promoting female-led startups and mentoring young women in business and innovation. This suggests she actively challenges traditional societal norms by empowering women in the tech industry, which is often male-dominated. Her actions align with not conforming to specific societal standards of behavior expected of women, indicating she does possess the characteristic of behaving differently. Therefore, the statement that she does not possess Behave Differently is contradicted by her actions and role in society.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context involves four individuals: Amina Yusuf, Priya Sharma, Maria Gonzalez, and Fatima Al-Mansoori. The generalized belief is about whether these individuals 'not possess Behave Differently,' meaning they do not conform to societal behavioral standards. Amina Yusuf is explicitly stated to challenge societal norms through her activism, making it true that she does not possess Behave Differently. Priya Sharma and Maria Gonzalez lack sufficient information in the context to confirm whether they conform to or deviate from societal norms, resulting in 'Not Sure' judgments. Fatima Al-Mansoori is described as actively challenging societal norms through her entrepreneurial efforts, making it false that she does not possess Behave Differently. Since the judgments include 'True' and 'Not Sure' for some individuals, there are counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the belief is a false generalization",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'For a woman, she was acting rather incarcerate' implies that the woman\u2019s behavior deviates from expected norms, suggesting a generalized belief that women should conform to specific behavioral standards. The generalized belief 'Women Are Expected To Behave Differently' reflects this assumption. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that the generalization is based on a small or inadequate sample, leading to a false belief. Since the generalization is false and not supported by evidence, it perpetuates a stereotype that women must behave in a certain way. This stereotype is counteracted by the existence of women who do not conform to these behavioral expectations, demonstrating the falsity of the generalization. The statement can thus be classified as a stereotype due to the false generalization from a small sample."
