{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Most of the teachers at school were quite kind. (statement)": "Most of the teachers at school were quite kind.",
  "Most Teachers Are Kind (generalized_belief)": "Most Teachers Are Kind generalizes the belief that most teachers exhibit kindness as a common trait. The statement removes qualifiers like 'most' to suggest a broader perception of teachers being generally kind",
  "Teachers (target_group)": "Generalized Perception about Group Defined by Profession",
  "kind (attribute)": "Emotion (generalized perception about teachers' behavior)",
  "Ms. Akande (individual)": "Ms. Akande is known to be part of the global community of Teachers, renowned for her role as an innovative curriculum designer in Lagos, Nigeria, where she combines traditional storytelling with modern pedagogy to engage students",
  "Mr. Patel (individual)": "Mr. Patel is recognized as a dedicated teacher within the Teachers group, serving as a mentor for underprivileged youth in Mumbai, India. His background includes years of volunteering at rural schools, emphasizing the transformative power of education",

Her experience spans both urban and rural classrooms, highlighting her commitment to bridging cultural gaps through language instruction",
  "Dr. Kim (individual)": "Dr. Kim is acknowledged among Teachers for her expertise as a STEM specialist based in Seoul, South Korea. With a background in engineering and a passion for technology, she inspires young women to pursue careers in science and technology",
  "not possess kind (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess kind\" suggests that an entity does not exhibit or embody a certain emotional quality or generalized perception typically associated with a particular group or category, as defined by the context. In this case, \"kind\" refers to an emotion related to teachers' behavior, meaning the entity in question lacks this emotional characteristic entirely, not just occasionally or temporarily. This absence is absolute and based on clear evidence or verification that the specific emotional quality is completely missing.",
  "False that Ms. Akande not possess kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ms. Akande is described as an innovative curriculum designer who combines traditional storytelling with modern pedagogy to engage students, which implies a high level of emotional intelligence and empathy in her teaching approach. The context strongly suggests that she embodies kindness in her profession, as these qualities are essential for effective engagement with students. Therefore, it is unreasonable to claim that she does not possess kindness.",
  "False that Mr. Patel not possess kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Mr. Patel is described as a dedicated teacher who mentors underprivileged youth and emphasizes the transformative power of education through years of volunteering at rural schools. This context clearly portrays him as embodying kindness and compassion in his actions and dedication to helping others. Therefore, it is unreasonable to infer that he does not possess kindness",
  "False that Se\u00f1ora L\u00f3pez not possess kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Se\u00f1ora L\u00f3pez is described as a respected teacher who bridges cultural gaps through language instruction, which strongly implies she exhibits kindness in her work. The context explicitly highlights her commitment and positive impact, making it unreasonable to infer she lacks kindness entirely. Therefore, the statement that she does not possess kindness is contradicted by the provided information: False that Se\u00f1ora L\u00f3pez not possess kind.  \nKey",
  "False that Dr. Kim not possess kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Dr. Kim is described as inspiring young women to pursue careers in science and technology, which indicates a kind and supportive emotional quality in her behavior. This directly contradicts the notion that she does not possess kindness. Therefore, the statement \"False that Dr. Kim not possess kind\" aligns with the context provided.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input provides a list of individual judgments stating 'False that [individual] not possess kind.' This means that for each individual, it has been explicitly determined that they do possess kindness. There is no 'Not Sure' or 'True' judgment for any individual in the list, indicating no counterexamples to the generalization. Based on the simplified logic provided, since none of the individuals are marked as lacking the attribute of kindness, there is no false generalization present. The context further supports this conclusion by explaining why each individual is likely to possess kindness, reinforcing the validity of the judgments. Therefore, the overall determination is that there is no false generalization in the group",
  "No (answer)": "The statement reflects a positive observation about most teachers being kind based on personal experience at school. The generalized belief extrapolates this observation into a broader claim that most teachers are kind. The judgement explicitly states 'No False Generalization,' meaning the generalization is not based on a misleading or inaccurate extrapolation from a limited sample. Since there\u2019s no false generalization, it cannot be categorized as a stereotype based on the provided criteria. Therefore, even though the belief implies a generalized attribute ('Most Teachers Are Kind'), it doesn't involve counterexamples or misrepresentation due to the judgement ruling out false generalization"
