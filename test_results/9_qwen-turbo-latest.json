{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Everyone in paraguay rides paragliding. (statement)": "Everyone in paraguay rides paragliding.",
  "Paraguayans Ride Paragliders (generalized_belief)": "The People of Paraguay Ride Paragliders generalizes the belief that all inhabitants of Paraguay engage in paragliding, ignoring potential exceptions or qualifiers like 'everyone.' The statement assumes a universal behavior among the population, forming a broad generalization about the nation's activities",
  "Paraguayans (target_group)": "Nationality-Based Generalization",
  "Ride Paragliders (attribute)": "Activity (generalized belief about Paraguayan people's behavior)",
  "Juan Gonzalez (individual)": "Juan Gonzalez is known to be part of the resilient Paraguayan community, recognized as an agricultural innovator in rural Caazap\u00e1, where he developed sustainable farming practices that have transformed local agriculture",
  "Maria Silva (individual)": "Maria Silva is known to be a vibrant member of the Paraguayan people, celebrated as a renowned musician from Asunci\u00f3n, whose traditional harp compositions have gained international acclaim",
  "Carlos L\u00f3pez (individual)": "Carlos L\u00f3pez is known to be a dedicated Paraguayan educator in the bustling city of Encarnaci\u00f3n, committed to empowering youth through bilingual literacy programs",
  "Ana Ramirez (individual)": "Ana Ramirez is known to be a trailblazing engineer from the dense forests of Alto Paran\u00e1, who pioneered eco-friendly infrastructure solutions benefiting indigenous communities",
  "not possess Ride Paragliders (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess Ride Paragliders\" suggests that there is an entity or group being described as lacking the characteristic or ability to engage in the activity of riding paragliders. Given the context, this implies a definitive absence of the skill, tool, or practice associated with riding paragliders. The use of \"not possess\" indicates that this absence is consistent and not temporary. The generalized belief about Paraguayan people's behavior adds context but does not directly define the statement; rather, it helps infer that the statement could relate to a specific group or entity being discussed. \n\nExplanation...",
  "True that Juan Gonzalez not possess Ride Paragliders (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Juan Gonzalez is described as an agricultural innovator focused on sustainable farming practices in rural Caazap\u00e1, with no mention of any involvement in activities related to paragliding. Given his established role and location, it is reasonable to infer that he does not possess the skill or interest in riding paragliders. Additionally, the context does not provide any information suggesting otherwise.",
  "True that Maria Silva not possess Ride Paragliders (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Silva is described as a renowned musician from Asunci\u00f3n, celebrated for her traditional harp compositions. There is no mention or implication in the provided context suggesting she has any connection to paragliding or related activities. Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that she does not possess the ability or interest in riding paragliders. Therefore, the statement aligns with the context and factual knowledge.",
  "True that Carlos L\u00f3pez not possess Ride Paragliders (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Carlos L\u00f3pez is described as a dedicated Paraguayan educator focused on bilingual literacy programs in Encarnaci\u00f3n, which provides no indication or context suggesting any involvement with paragliding activities. Given his professional role and area of expertise, it is logical to infer that engaging in paragliding is highly unlikely and irrelevant to his known pursuits. Therefore, the statement aligns with the context and factual knowledge provided.",
  "False that Ana Ramirez not possess Ride Paragliders. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ana Ramirez is described as an engineer focused on eco-friendly infrastructure solutions for indigenous communities, with no mention of any involvement or affinity with activities like paragliding. Given her professional background and area of expertise, it is reasonable to infer that she likely does not possess the skill or interest in riding paragliders. Therefore, the statement aligns with logical inference based on the provided context: False that Ana Ramirez not possess Ride Paragliders. \n\nExplanation: The context highlights Ana Ramirez\u2019s professional achievements and focus on engineering solutions, which does not suggest any connection to paragliding activities. This aligns with the inference that she does not possess the skill or interest in riding paragliders.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "In the provided list of individual judgments, the evaluations for each person's ability to ride paragliders are as follows: 'True that Juan Gonzalez not possess Ride Paragliders', 'True that Maria Silva not possess Ride Paragliders', 'True that Carlos L\u00f3pez not possess Ride Paragliders', and 'False that Ana Ramirez not possess Ride Paragliders'. The judgment for Ana Ramirez explicitly states 'False' rather than 'True', indicating that it is judged that she does possess the ability to ride paragliders. Since the generalization claims that NO individual possesses the ability to ride paragliders, and Ana Ramirez is explicitly judged to possess this ability ('False that Ana Ramirez not possess Ride Paragliders'), this serves as a counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, the generalization is false due to the presence of at least one individual (Ana Ramirez) who is judged to possess the ability to ride paragliders. Thus, the judgment is Yes False Generalization.",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'Everyone in Paraguay rides paragliding' implies a generalized belief that all Paraguayans engage in paragliding, which is an overgeneralization of the population's behavior. The target group consists of Paraguayans, who are inhabitants of Paraguay. The judgement indicates a 'Yes False Generalization,' meaning the claim is proven incorrect by evidence showing that not every individual in the sample fits the described attribute. Specifically, Ana Ramirez is cited as an example of someone who does ride paragliders, contradicting the universal claim of the generalized belief. This contradiction demonstrates that the belief is a false generalization. Since stereotypes often arise from such false generalizations, this belief can indeed be classified as a stereotype, with Ana Ramirez serving as a counterexample to the stereotype: Paraguayans Do Not All Ride Paragliders"
