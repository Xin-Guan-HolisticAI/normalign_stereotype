{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "not possess Speak English (not_possess_attribute)": "The phrase \"not possess Speak English\" suggests that the subject lacks the characteristic or ability of speaking English, based on the definition provided for \"not possess\" and the understanding that \"Speak English\" refers to a linguistic capability. This means the subject entirely and consistently does not have the skill or habit of speaking English, with no exceptions, as the statement is absolute and not subject to temporary conditions.",
  "False that John Nguyen not possess Speak English (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "John Nguyen is described as an innovative software engineer in Silicon Valley, a region where proficiency in English is essential for professional success and communication. Additionally, the context mentions that he grew up in the US, which implies exposure to and fluency in English from an early age. Therefore, it is logical to infer that John Nguyen possesses the ability to speak English.",
  "False that Maria L\u00f3pez not possess Speak English (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria L\u00f3pez is a dedicated public school teacher in Chicago, Illinois, which is a bilingual and multicultural urban environment where speaking English is essential for professional success and daily communication. Given her role as a teacher and her advocacy for equitable education policies, it is highly unlikely that she lacks the ability to speak English, as this would severely hinder her ability to perform her job effectively. Therefore, the statement \"Maria L\u00f3pez not possess Speak English\" is contradicted by the context.",
  "False that Carlos Patel not possess Speak English (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Carlos Patel is an architect celebrated in New York City, and while the context highlights his Indian heritage and global travel experiences, there is no explicit mention of his language skills. However, given that he operates professionally in the United States, where English is predominantly spoken, it is reasonable to infer that he likely possesses the ability to speak English, even if it is not stated outright. Therefore, the statement \"Carlos Patel not possess Speak English\" is likely false based on logical inference.",
  "False that Aisha Johnson not possess Speak English. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Aisha Johnson is described as a community health worker in rural Mississippi, which strongly implies that she must communicate effectively within her profession, likely requiring proficiency in English given the location and nature of her work. Additionally, her active role within the People Of US suggests engagement in social contexts where English is predominantly spoken. Therefore, it is logical to infer that Aisha Johnson possesses the ability to speak English",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input provides a list of individual judgments regarding whether certain people possess the ability to speak English. According to the list, all four individuals\u2014John Nguyen, Maria L\u00f3pez, Carlos Patel, and Aisha Johnson\u2014are judged as possessing the ability to speak English ('False that [individual] not possess Speak English'). The context further supports this conclusion for three out of the four individuals. John Nguyen is described as working in Silicon Valley, where English proficiency is essential, and since he grew up in the US, fluency in English is expected. Maria L\u00f3pez is a teacher in Chicago, where English is also essential for professional success, and her role as an educator makes it highly unlikely that she lacks English-speaking ability. Carlos Patel is an architect in New York City, and although the context does not explicitly state his English-speaking ability, operating professionally in the US suggests he likely speaks English. However, for Aisha Johnson, there is no context provided at all, resulting in a 'None' judgment. Since the absence of context introduces uncertainty, the judgment for Aisha Johnson is marked as 'Not Sure that Aisha Johnson not possess Speak English'. Following the rules outlined, because there is at least one 'Not Sure' judgment, the overall determination is that there is a false generalization. Thus, the key summary reflects this conclusion.",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'People of US typically speak the English language' implies that speaking English is a common trait among Americans, but when generalized to 'People Of US Speak English,' it removes the qualifier 'typically' and suggests all Americans speak English. This broader claim lacks nuance and could lead to false generalization because not every individual in the U.S. speaks English fluently due to factors like regional dialects, cultural diversity, and immigrant populations with different linguistic backgrounds. The judgement confirms this as a 'Yes False Generalization,' meaning the belief is indeed overbroad. Since stereotypes often arise from such false generalizations, this belief can be classified as a stereotype. Counterexamples include native non-English speakers within the U.S., such as certain indigenous groups or recent immigrants who may not speak English fluently"
