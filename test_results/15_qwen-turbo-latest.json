{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "not possess Safe For Tourists (not_possess_attribute)": "A place or entity described by the statement \"not possess Safe For Tourists\" means it fundamentally lacks the characteristic or attribute of being considered safe or suitable for tourists, based on a generalized belief about its safety features.

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Fatima Patel is described as a tech-savvy digital nomad who balances career and leisure, with a current residence in Bali, a location renowned for its scenic beauty and vacation-friendly environment.

There is no indication in the context that Maria Gonzalez herself lacks the characteristics of being safe or suitable for tourists.

Therefore, it is logical to infer that Maria Gonzalez does possess the qualities associated with being safe for tourists.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Jin Park is described as an international student navigating Southeast Asia with classmates, leveraging his knowledge of local languages and customs, which implies he possesses attributes beneficial for ensuring safety and suitability for tourists.

Therefore, it is false that Lila Patel does not possess Safe For Tourists.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The provided list of individual judgments shows that each person ('Maria Gonzalez', 'Ahmed Al-Mansouri', 'Fatima Patel', and 'Liam O'Connor') has been evaluated as 'False' regarding the claim that they do not possess the attribute 'Great For Vacation'. This indicates that, based on the context given, all four individuals are explicitly stated to possess qualities associated with being great for vacation experiences. Since 'False' judgments mean that none of them lack the attribute, there are no counterexamples to the generalization within this group. Therefore, following the logic outlined in the instructions, since ALL individuals possess the attribute, there is NO FALSE GENERALIZATION detected in this case",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input provides a list of individual judgements assessing whether certain people possess the attribute 'Safe For Tourists'. The context explains each person's situation and their relevance to the attribute. Maria Gonzalez, Jin Park, and Lila Patel are explicitly stated to possess the attribute based on their roles and activities, as their involvement in tourism-related tasks implies adherence to safety norms. However, for Ahmed Al-Farid, the context notes that there is no explicit evidence confirming he lacks the attribute, but it also doesn't confirm his possession of it. Since the judgement for Ahmed Al-Farid is marked as 'Not Sure', this introduces uncertainty into the overall generalization. According to the rules provided, if ANY individual is judged as 'Not Sure', the overall conclusion must be that there is a false generalization. Thus, the presence of 'Not Sure' for Ahmed Al-Farid indicates that there is at least one counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, the final judgment is based on this single instance of uncertainty.",
  "No. (answer)": "Since the judgement explicitly states 'No False Generalization,' this means that the generalized belief that 'Peru Is Great For Vacation' holds true across the small sample size, implying that all individuals in the target group (Peru) align with the attributed quality of being great for vacations. The generalized belief is that Peru possesses qualities making it an ideal location for leisure activities, and this belief is not contradicted by any counterexamples in the given data. As per the criteria, the statement cannot be classified as a stereotype because there is no evidence of false generalization\u2014no individual in the sample disproves the generalized belief. Therefore, the statement does not imply a stereotype based on the given judgment",
  "Yes (answer)": "The input suggests that the statement 'Peru Is Safe For Tourists' generalizes the safety of Peru as a universal truth based on limited evidence. The generalized belief implied here is that Peru is secure and suitable for all tourists. The target group consists of tourists visiting Peru, but there is no mention of specific sampled individuals or data showing evidence for this claim. Since the judgement explicitly states 'Yes False Generalization,' it indicates that this belief is indeed a stereotype formed without sufficient basis. Counterexamples to this stereotype could include instances where Peru might have safety concerns, such as political unrest or crime in certain areas, which are ignored in the generalized belief"
