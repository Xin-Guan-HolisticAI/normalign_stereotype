{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "not possess A Nice Place To Visit (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess A Nice Place To Visit\" implies that a particular entity or place lacks the characteristic of being perceived positively as a pleasant or enjoyable travel destination.

However, the context does not explicitly state or logically infer that Aisha Patel herself possesses a nice place to visit in the sense of owning or being personally tied to such a location. Therefore, the statement \"Aisha Patel not possess A Nice Place To Visit\" cannot be definitively confirmed or denied based solely on the given context.",
  "Not Sure that Carlos Morales not possess A Nice Place To Visit (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provides details about Carlos Morales's professional life and expertise but does not mention anything about his personal preferences, lifestyle, or any place he might own or visit.

These details suggest she is actively involved in areas that promote positive perceptions of her origin and work, which could imply a connection to places or contexts that people might find interesting or pleasant to visit. Therefore, it is logical to infer that Fatima Al-Khawarizmi does possess a place that could be considered a nice place to visit, at least indirectly through her contributions and affiliations.",

The context explicitly states that he speaks perfect English, making any claim that he does not possess this ability false.

  "False that Amina Rahman not possess Speaks Perfect English.\n\nKey = False that Amina Rahman not possess Speaks Perfect English (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Amina Rahman is described as working within a globally connected network of professionals who speak perfect English and is noted for her role as a United Nations interpreter in Geneva, which requires exceptional fluency in multiple languages, including English. Given her professional responsibilities and the high standards implied by her position, it is unreasonable to infer that she lacks the ability to speak perfect English. Therefore, the statement \"Amina Rahman not possess Speaks Perfect English\" is contradicted by the context provided",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The input provides a list of individual judgments related to the claim 'Speaks Perfect English.' Each judgment assesses whether the respective individual possesses this attribute. The context explains the situation for some individuals: Amara Patel is described as a prominent dialect coach proficient in phonetics and linguistics, explicitly indicating her ability to speak perfect English. Carlos Mendez is described as a bilingual high school teacher in Miami who also speaks perfect English, further confirming his possession of this attribute. However, for two individuals (Li Wei and Amina Rahman), the context is missing, leaving their status regarding the attribute uncertain. Since at least two individuals lack sufficient context to confirm their possession of the attribute, this introduces the possibility of a counterexample. According to the rules, if ANY individual is judged as 'Not Sure' or 'True' that they do not possess the attribute, the generalization is considered false. As there are cases of 'Not Sure,' the overall judgment must be 'Yes False Generalization' because the absence of confirmation for certain individuals creates uncertainty about the validity of the generalization.",
  "Yes (answer)": "The input statement suggests that because Britain is a nice place to visit, a person (referred to as 'she') speaks perfect English. This implies a generalized belief that being associated with Britain equates to having perfect English-speaking skills. The generalized belief is 'People from Britain speak perfect English.' The sampled individual mentioned ('she') is not representative of all Britons but is instead a single example. There is no evidence provided to suggest this individual's English-speaking ability is reflective of the broader population of Britain. Since the judgement indicates 'Yes False Generalization,' this means the belief is indeed based on an unrepresentative sample. Therefore, this generalized belief can be classified as a stereotype, as it applies an attribute (perfect English-speaking) to an entire group (Britons) based on limited or flawed reasoning. Counterexamples to this stereotype could include any Britons who do not speak perfect English, thus disproving the broad generalization"
