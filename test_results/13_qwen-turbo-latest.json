  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Japanese man dressed well. (statement)": "Japanese man dressed well.",
  "Japanese Men Dress Well (generalized_belief)": "Japanese Men Dress Well implies that Japanese men are generally associated with dressing in an elegant or stylish manner. The statement removes specificity around 'man' to suggest a broader belief about the group.",
  "Japanese Men (target_group)": "Generalized Belief About Appearance and Style Focused on Gender and Nationality...",
  "Dress Well (attribute)": "Trait (associated with style/elegance in dressing...)",
  "Takumi Nakamura (individual)": "Takumi Nakamura is known to be part of the group of Japanese men celebrated for their contributions to technology and innovation, working as a robotics engineer in Tokyo, where he grew up immersed in both traditional Japanese culture and modern urban life, blending ancient crafts with cutting-edge robotics",
  "Hiroshi Tanaka (individual)": "Hiroshi Tanaka is known to be part of the group of Japanese men recognized for their dedication to martial arts, teaching karate in Okinawa, the birthplace of karate, where he spent years mastering techniques and preserving historical practices",
  "Yuki Suzuki (individual)": "Yuki Suzuki is known to be part of the group of Japanese men associated with artistic achievements, serving as a renowned calligrapher in Kyoto, a city steeped in history and aesthetic traditions, where she learned the art from her grandmother and honed her skills over decades",
  "Kenji Fujimoto (individual)": "Kenji Fujimoto is known to be part of the group of Japanese men admired for their resilience and leadership, leading a community development project in Hokkaido, where he was raised in a farming family and leveraged his experiences to empower rural communities",
  "not possess Dress Well (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that someone or something \"not possess Dress Well\" means they lack the specific attribute or trait associated with dressing elegantly or stylishly. This indicates an absolute absence of the characteristic of dressing well, implying that there is clear and consistent evidence showing no presence of this style or elegance in their manner of dressing.",
  "Not Sure that Takumi Nakamura not possess Dress Well (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Takumi Nakamura is described as blending traditional Japanese culture with modern urban life, which suggests an awareness of aesthetics and style, potentially including how he dresses. However, the context does not explicitly mention his personal style or dressing habits, leaving room for uncertainty about whether he possesses the trait of dressing well.",
  "True that Hiroshi Tanaka not possess Dress Well. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Hiroshi Tanaka is deeply committed to martial arts and preserving historical karate practices, which suggests his focus is on tradition and skill development rather than fashion or style. There is no mention of him being involved in activities related to elegance or fashion, supporting the notion that he might not prioritize dressing well.",
  "False that Yuki Suzuki not possess Dress Well (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Yuki Suzuki is a renowned calligrapher in Kyoto, a city known for its rich aesthetic traditions, and she learned her art from her grandmother, suggesting a deep connection to cultural and artistic elegance. Given her association with such a historically aesthetic background and her decades-long dedication to calligraphy, it is reasonable to infer that she possesses an inherent sense of style and elegance, which likely extends to her manner of dressing. Therefore, the statement that Yuki Suzuki does not possess Dress Well is contradicted by the context and logical inference.",
  "Not Sure that Kenji Fujimoto not possess Dress Well (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provides information about Kenji Fujimoto's leadership and community work in Hokkaido but does not mention anything about his personal style or how he dresses. Without specific details regarding his attire or fashion sense, it is impossible to confirm or infer whether he possesses the trait of dressing well or not. Therefore, based on the lack of relevant information:  \n\nLogical reasoning cannot determine if Kenji Fujimoto dresses well or not, so we cannot affirmatively support either claim.",
  "Yes (answer)": "The input provides a statement observing that a 'Japanese man dressed well,' which is then generalized into the belief that 'Japanese Men Dress Well.' This implies associating all Japanese men with a specific attribute of dressing elegantly or stylishly. The sample size here is extremely small, consisting of just one individual, and no other data points are provided to support the generalization. According to the judgement rule, since the input specifies 'Yes False generalization,' it indicates that the belief is indeed a false generalization. A stereotype occurs when a generalized belief about a group is formed based on limited or inaccurate information. In this case, the generalization from a single observation could lead to stereotyping, as it assumes all Japanese men share this trait without evidence. However, since no counterexamples are provided in the input, it cannot definitively identify specific individuals as counterexamples to the stereotype. Therefore, the statement can be classified as potentially contributing to a stereotype due to false generalization"
