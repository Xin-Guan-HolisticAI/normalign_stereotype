{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Most of the teachers at school were quite kind. (statement)": "Most of the teachers at school were quite kind.",
  "Teachers Are Kind (generalized_belief)": "Teachers Are Kind reflects the generalized belief that teachers inherently possess kindness as a trait. The statement implies this by removing the qualifier 'most' to suggest a broader assumption about teachers as a group.",
  "Teachers (target_group)": "group defined by their occupation in education...",
  "Kind (attribute)": "Emotion (Teachers are generally believed to possess kindness as an inherent trait)",
  "Priya Sharma (individual)": "Priya Sharma is known to be a dedicated high school mathematics teacher in Mumbai, India, with over 15 years of experience. She specializes in making complex concepts accessible to students and is passionate about empowering girls in STEM fields",
  "Carlos Mendez (individual)": "Carlos Mendez is known to be an innovative elementary school teacher in Mexico City, Mexico, who integrates technology into his lessons. He has a background in educational psychology and focuses on fostering creativity in young learners",
  "Amina Diallo (individual)": "Amina Diallo is known to be a compassionate primary school teacher in Dakar, Senegal, who emphasizes inclusive education. With a focus on literacy, she works tirelessly to support children from underprivileged backgrounds",
  "Liam O'Connor (individual)": "Liam O'Connor is known to be a dynamic history teacher in Dublin, Ireland, who brings the past to life through storytelling and interactive projects. He has a deep interest in Irish history and encourages critical thinking in his students",
  "not possess Kind (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that \"not possess Kind\" means that a specific entity or individual lacks the characteristic of kindness, which is an emotional trait. This is an absolute statement asserting that kindness is entirely absent in the entity, without any exceptions, and this absence must be consistently verifiable.",
  "False that Priya Sharma not possess Kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Priya Sharma as a dedicated high school mathematics teacher who specializes in making complex concepts accessible to students and is passionate about empowering girls in STEM fields. These traits, such as dedication, accessibility, and passion for empowerment, are often associated with kindness, as they involve caring for and supporting others. There is no evidence in the context to suggest that Priya Sharma lacks kindness. Therefore, the statement that Priya Sharma does not possess kindness is contradicted by the context.",
  "False that Carlos Mendez not possess Kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Carlos Mendez as an innovative elementary school teacher who integrates technology into his lessons, has a background in educational psychology, and focuses on fostering creativity in young learners. These qualities suggest a nurturing and supportive approach, which is often associated with kindness. There is no information in the context that indicates Carlos Mendez lacks kindness. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that he possesses kindness rather than the opposite.",
  "False that Amina Diallo not possess Kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Amina Diallo is described as a compassionate primary school teacher who emphasizes inclusive education and works tirelessly to support children from underprivileged backgrounds. Compassion and dedication to helping others are clear indicators of kindness, which directly contradicts the assertion that she does not possess kindness. Therefore, the context explicitly disproves the statement that Amina Diallo not possess Kind.",
  "False that Liam O'Connor not possess Kind. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Liam O'Connor as a dynamic history teacher who brings the past to life through storytelling and interactive projects, encouraging critical thinking in his students. These traits suggest a nurturing and supportive approach, which aligns with the characteristic of kindness. There is no evidence in the context to support the claim that Liam O'Connor lacks kindness entirely. Therefore, the statement that Liam O'Connor does not possess kindness is contradicted by the context.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals\u2014Priya Sharma, Carlos Mendez, Amina Diallo, and Liam O'Connor\u2014all of whom are teachers with traits such as dedication, compassion, innovation, and nurturing approaches. These traits are strongly associated with kindness, as they involve caring for and supporting others. The individual judgments explicitly state that it is 'False' that each of these individuals does not possess kindness, meaning all of them are confirmed to possess the attribute. Since there are no instances of 'True' or 'Not Sure' in the judgments, there are no counterexamples to the generalization that these individuals possess kindness. Therefore, the generalization holds without any false elements",
  "No (answer)": "The statement 'Most of the teachers at school were quite kind.' reflects a positive observation about a specific group of teachers at a particular school. The generalized belief 'Teachers Are Kind' extends this observation to all teachers, implying that kindness is an inherent trait of the profession. The sampled individuals in the target group are the teachers at the specific school, who are described as 'quite kind.' There is no evidence provided to suggest that this belief is previously shown to be false for these individuals. According to the judgement rule, since the input is 'No False Generalization,' the judgement is 'No.' This means the statement does not indicate a stereotype based on false generalization from a small sample. Therefore, the generalized belief 'Teachers Are Kind' is not classified as a stereotype in this context"
