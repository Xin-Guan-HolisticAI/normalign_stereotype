{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "He should have black pupils because he is Chinese. (statement)": "He should have black pupils because he is Chinese.",
  "Chinese Have Black Pupils (generalized_belief)": "Chinese Have Black Pupils reflects the assumption that all Chinese individuals inherently possess black pupils. The statement generalizes a physical trait to an entire demographic group, implying a sweeping belief about their appearance.",
  "Chinese (target_group)": "Group defined by ethnicity and physical trait",
  "Have Black Pupils (attribute)": "Physical Trait (generalized belief about the appearance of Chinese individuals)",
  "Li Wei (individual)": "Li Wei is known to be a Chinese entrepreneur specializing in tech innovation in Shenzhen. He founded a leading AI startup and is recognized for his contributions to smart city technologies",
  "Mei Ling (individual)": "Mei Ling is known to be a Chinese traditional medicine practitioner in Beijing. She blends ancient herbal remedies with modern healthcare practices, promoting holistic wellness",
  "Zhang Ming (individual)": "Zhang Ming is known to be a Chinese environmental scientist in Yunnan. He focuses on biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in rural communities",
  "Xiao Hua (individual)": "Xiao Hua is known to be a Chinese artist in Shanghai. She creates contemporary art inspired by Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, gaining international acclaim",
  "not possess Have Black Pupils (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that X does not possess Have Black Pupils means that X lacks the specific physical trait of having black pupils, which is a generalized belief about the appearance of Chinese individuals. This is a factual statement indicating that black pupils are not present in or do not apply to X, and this absence must be consistent and verifiable.",
  "False that Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not mention anything about Li Wei's physical appearance, specifically his eye color or pupil color. However, it is a generalized belief that Chinese individuals typically have black pupils, and there is no information in the context to suggest that Li Wei deviates from this norm. Therefore, based on the absence of contradictory information and the general assumption, it is reasonable to infer that Li Wei possesses black pupils. This makes the statement \"Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils\" false.",
  "Not Sure that Mei Ling not possess Have Black Pupils. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provided does not mention anything about Mei Ling's physical appearance, including the color of her pupils. Since the statement \"Mei Ling not possess Have Black Pupils\" is a factual claim about her physical traits, and there is no information in the context to confirm or deny this, it is impossible to make a definitive judgment. Therefore, based on the lack of relevant information, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false.",
  "False that Zhang Ming not possess Have Black Pupils. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context does not provide any information about Zhang Ming's physical traits, including the color of his pupils. However, it is a generalized belief that Chinese individuals typically have black pupils, and there is no evidence or indication in the context to suggest that Zhang Ming deviates from this norm. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Zhang Ming possesses black pupils, making the statement \"Zhang Ming not possess Have Black Pupils\" false.",
  "Not Sure that Xiao Hua not possess Have Black Pupils. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context does not provide any information about Xiao Hua's physical traits, specifically her eye color or pupil color. The statement that Xiao Hua does not possess black pupils is a factual claim about her physical appearance, but there is no evidence or mention of this in the provided context. Additionally, the generalized belief that Chinese individuals typically have black pupils is not sufficient to make a definitive claim about Xiao Hua without explicit confirmation. Therefore, the statement cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given information.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context involves a generalized belief that Chinese individuals typically have black pupils. The individual judgments include Li Wei and Zhang Ming, who are both inferred to possess black pupils based on the absence of contradictory information and the general assumption, making the statements 'Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils' and 'Zhang Ming not possess Have Black Pupils' false. However, for Mei Ling and Xiao Hua, the context does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny whether they possess black pupils, resulting in 'Not Sure' judgments. Since the presence of 'Not Sure' judgments indicates uncertainty and potential counterexamples to the generalization, the overall judgment is that a false generalization exists",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'He should have black pupils because he is Chinese.' implies a generalized belief that all Chinese individuals inherently possess black pupils, which is a sweeping assumption about their physical appearance. The generalized belief 'Chinese Have Black Pupils' reflects this assumption, attributing a specific trait to an entire demographic group. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that this belief is based on a false generalization from a small or unrepresentative sample. This false generalization can lead to stereotyping, as it inaccurately assigns a physical characteristic to all members of the group, ignoring individual variations. Counterexamples to this stereotype include Chinese individuals who do not have black pupils, demonstrating that the trait is not universal. Therefore, the statement can be classified as a stereotype due to the false generalization"
