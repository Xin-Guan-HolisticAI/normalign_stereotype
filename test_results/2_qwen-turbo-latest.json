{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Mathematicians solve problems (statement)": "Mathematicians solve problems",
  "Mathematicians Solve Problems (generalized_belief)": "Mathematicians Solve Problems emphasizes the action-oriented belief that mathematicians engage in problem-solving activities. The statement directly attributes this behavior to the group, implying a core function of mathematicians in their professional or intellectual capacity",

  "Emmy Noether (individual)": "Emmy Noether was a trailblazer within the group of Mathematicians, celebrated for her revolutionary work in abstract algebra and theoretical physics, hailing from Erlangen, Germany, and overcoming gender barriers to become one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century",
  "Terence Tao (individual)": "Terence Tao is acknowledged as a leading member of the Mathematicians community, coming from Adelaide, Australia, with prodigious talent recognized early on, excelling in fields like harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and analytic number theory",
  "not possess Solve Problems (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that something \"does not possess Solve Problems\" means that it lacks the specific attribute or characteristic of actively engaging in problem-solving activities, which is described in the context as an action-oriented behavior primarily associated with mathematicians. This indicates an absolute absence of such behavior, rather than a temporary or occasional lack.",
  "False that Carl Friedrich Gauss not possess Solve Problems. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Carl Friedrich Gauss is celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to number theory, astronomy, and physics, which clearly demonstrate his active engagement in solving complex problems throughout his life. The context explicitly portrays him as a prominent figure in mathematics who engaged in problem-solving activities consistently. Therefore, the claim that he does not possess the ability to solve problems is directly contradicted by the factual knowledge provided",
  "False that Srinivasa Ramanujan not possess Solve Problems. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Srinivasa Ramanujan is celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to mathematical analysis, infinite series, and continued fractions, demonstrating an exceptional ability to solve complex problems throughout his life. His work, despite being self-taught, shows persistent engagement in solving mathematical challenges, directly contradicting the claim that he lacked this ability.",
  "False that Emmy Noether not possess Solve Problems (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Emmy Noether is renowned for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics, which involved solving complex problems and developing innovative theories. Her work directly demonstrates her active engagement in problem-solving activities, making the claim that she does not possess the ability to solve problems clearly incorrect.",
  "False that Terence Tao not possess Solve Problems (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Terence Tao is a renowned mathematician who has made significant contributions to solving complex problems in fields such as harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and analytic number theory. The context explicitly describes him as actively engaging in problem-solving activities, which directly contradicts the notion that he does not possess the ability to solve problems. Therefore, the statement \"False that Terence Tao not possess Solve Problems\" holds true. Additionally, the double negation in the original statement (\"not possess Solve Problems\") reinforces this conclusion, as the negation of \"not Action\" implies active engagement in the action itself.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "All individuals in the group explicitly demonstrate their ability to solve problems through their well-documented achievements in mathematics and theoretical physics. For instance, Carl Friedrich Gauss is celebrated for his contributions to number theory, algebra, statistics, and many other fields, showcasing his proficiency in solving complex problems. Similarly, Srinivasa Ramanujan, despite his lack of formal education, independently solved numerous mathematical problems, leaving a lasting legacy. Emmy Noether\u2019s innovations in abstract algebra and theoretical physics further solidify her problem-solving abilities. Terence Tao\u2019s contributions to various branches of mathematics also affirm his expertise in solving intricate problems. Since every individual in the group is described as possessing the attribute of solving problems and none are labeled as 'Not Sure' or 'True that [individual] not possess Solve Problems,' there is no counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, the overall judgment concludes that there is no false generalization among the group.",
  "No (answer)": "The input specifies that the statement 'Mathematicians solve problems' reflects a generalized belief that all mathematicians are inherently engaged in problem-solving activities. This belief implies that solving problems is a core function of mathematicians, which could be seen as an attribute assigned to the entire group. The target group here consists of mathematicians, defined broadly as professionals or academics working in fields that involve mathematical theory or application. The judgment indicates 'No False Generalization,' meaning that based on the provided context, there is no evidence suggesting the generalization is inaccurate for the sampled individuals. Since no false generalization exists, this specific belief cannot be classified as a stereotype derived from a small sample. Stereotypes arise when a generalized belief is inaccurately applied to an entire group based on limited or biased observations. As the judgment explicitly denies the presence of false generalization, it follows that this particular belief about mathematicians does not qualify as a stereotype in this instance"
