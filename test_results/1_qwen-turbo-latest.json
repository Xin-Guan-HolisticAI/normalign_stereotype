{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Russians are born in Russia (statement)": "Russians are born in Russia",
  "All Russians Originate From Russia (generalized_belief)": "All Russians Originate From Russia implies that all individuals identified as Russian must have been born within the geographical boundaries of Russia. This belief removes ambiguity around terms like 'some' or 'many,' suggesting a definitive connection between Russianness and birthplace.",
  "Russians (target_group)": "Geographical Origin Implies Birthplace Connection",
  "Originate From Russia (attribute)": "Geographical Origin (all individuals identified as Russian must have been born within Russia's geographical boundaries)",
  "Ivan Petrovich (individual)": "Ivan Petrovich is known to be part of the resilient Russian people, a skilled cosmonaut representing the nation's pioneering spirit in space exploration, born and raised in the freezing Siberian region where he developed an enduring toughness and love for exploration",
  "Natalia Sokolova (individual)": "Natalia Sokolova is known to be a member of the culturally rich Russian society, an acclaimed ballet dancer embodying the grace and artistry of Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre tradition, trained at the prestigious Vaganova Ballet Academy since childhood",
  "Dmitry Volkov (individual)": "Dmitry Volkov is known to be among the industrious Russian engineers, leading cutting-edge robotics projects in St. Petersburg, where he grew up amidst the city's technological hubs and academic excellence",
  "Sofia Orlova (individual)": "Sofia Orlova is known to be a symbol of Russia's vibrant literary heritage, a celebrated novelist capturing the soul of rural villages in the Golden Ring region, drawing inspiration from her upbringing surrounded by ancient architecture and folklore",
  "not possess Originate From Russia (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess Originate From Russia\" means that something or someone lacks the specific attribute of having a geographical origin in Russia. In other words, it indicates that the entity being discussed was not born within Russia's geographical boundaries, as per the definition provided. This is an absolute claim, meaning there is clear and consistent evidence showing that the entity has no connection to Russia as its place of birth.",
  "Ivan Petrovich is indeed of Russian origin, as he was born and raised in Siberia, a part of Russia. Since there is no ambiguity or lack of information, we can confidently judge this claim.\n\nFalse that Ivan Petrovich not possess Originate From Russia. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ivan Petrovich is explicitly described as being born and raised in the Siberian region of Russia, which clearly establishes his geographical origin in Russia. This directly contradicts the claim that he does not originate from Russia. Therefore, the statement \"Ivan Petrovich not possess Originate From Russia\" is false based on the given context",
  "False that Natalia Sokolova not possess Originate From Russia. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Natalia Sokolova is described as a member of the culturally rich Russian society and an acclaimed ballet dancer associated with the Bolshoi Theatre tradition, having trained at the prestigious Vaganova Ballet Academy since childhood. These details clearly establish her deep connection to Russia, making the claim that she does not originate from Russia inconsistent with the given context.",
  "False that Dmitry Volkov not possess Originate From Russia. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Dmitry Volkov is explicitly described as a Russian engineer leading projects in St. Petersburg, a city where he grew up amidst technological hubs and academic excellence. This context clearly establishes his connection to Russia, directly contradicting the claim that he does not originate from Russia. Given this explicit information, it is unreasonable to infer otherwise.",
  "False that Sofia Orlova not possess Originate From Russia. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Sofia Orlova is described as a celebrated novelist who captures the soul of rural villages in the Golden Ring region of Russia, drawing inspiration from her upbringing surrounded by ancient architecture and folklore. This context strongly suggests that she has a deep connection to Russia and is likely from there, as her work is deeply rooted in Russian culture and geography. Therefore, it is logical to infer that Sofia Orlova does indeed originate from Russia.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "All provided individual judgments explicitly state 'False that [individual] not possess Originate From Russia,' indicating that there is no uncertainty or ambiguity regarding their Russian origins. Each person\u2014whether Ivan Petrovich, Natalia Sokolova, Dmitry Volkov, or Sofia Orlova\u2014is firmly established as being of Russian origin based on the given contexts. Since none of the individuals exhibit attributes contradicting the generalization or introduce uncertainty, there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the overall judgment is that there is no false generalization present in the group.",
  "No. (answer)": "In the provided input, the generalized belief states that 'All Russians Originate From Russia,' implying that every individual identified as Russian must have been born within the geographical boundaries of Russia. The statement 'Russians are born in Russia' further reinforces this belief. The judgement explicitly claims 'No False Generalization,' meaning that no counterexamples were found among the sampled individuals\u2014such as Ivan Petrovich, Natalia Sokolova, Dmitry Volkov, or Sofia Orlova\u2014who are all firmly established as being of Russian origin based on the given contexts. Since no contradictions or ambiguities arose from these samples, the belief does not qualify as a stereotype under the given generalization judgement. Therefore, the statement cannot be classified as a stereotype due to false generalization from a small sample"
