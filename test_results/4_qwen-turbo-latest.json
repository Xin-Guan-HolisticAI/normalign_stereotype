{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "He should have black pupils because he is Chinese. (statement)": "He should have black pupils because he is Chinese.",
  "The Chinese Have Black Pupils (generalized_belief)": "The Chinese Have Black Pupils generalizes the belief that all Chinese individuals inherently have black pupils, removing the hypothetical qualifier 'should' to establish a deterministic claim",
  "The Chinese (target_group)": "Belief about Physical Trait",
  "Have Black Pupils (attribute)": "Physical Trait (describing eye color as a generalization about Chinese people)",
  "Li Wei (individual)": "Li Wei is known to be part of The Chinese, a culturally rich and historically diverse community renowned for its contributions to technology and innovation. Li Wei is an AI researcher specializing in natural language processing at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. Born and raised in Shanghai, Li Wei grew up immersed in the city's fast-paced tech scene and developed a passion for linguistics and machine learning during her studies abroad in California",
  "Chen Jun (individual)": "Chen Jun is known to be part of The Chinese, a nation celebrated for its deep-rooted traditions and artistic excellence. Chen Jun is a master calligrapher who teaches traditional brushwork techniques in Suzhou, a city famous for its classical gardens. Originally from Hangzhou, Chen Jun learned calligraphy from her grandmother and later refined her skills at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing",
  "Dong Wei (individual)": "Dong Wei is known to be part of The Chinese, a people admired for their entrepreneurial spirit and global trade networks. Dong Wei is a successful international trader based in Guangzhou, often referred to as China\u2019s \u201cFactory to the World.\u201d Hailing from Shandong province, Dong Wei began exporting goods to Southeast Asia after graduating from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou",
  "Wang Mei (individual)": "Wang Mei is known to be part of The Chinese, a civilization recognized for its ancient philosophies and contemporary cultural influence. Wang Mei is a philosopher focusing on Confucian thought and ethics at Fudan University in Shanghai. Raised in Chengdu, she developed an interest in Eastern philosophy while studying abroad in Kyoto, Japan",
  "not possess Have Black Pupils (not_possess_attribute)": "The statement \"not possess Have Black Pupils\" suggests that the subject being discussed lacks the physical trait of having black pupils, which is described in the context as a generalization about Chinese people. This implies that the subject either has a different eye color or lacks the characteristic entirely, based on an absolute assertion of absence rather than variability or exception.",
  "False that Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provides information about Li Wei being part of the Chinese community and mentions her background but does not discuss any specific physical traits such as eye color. However, the generalization about Chinese people having black pupils applies to the vast majority unless specified otherwise. Since no contradictory information is provided, it is reasonable to infer that Li Wei likely possesses this trait. Thus, the statement \"Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils\" is false. Additionally, the double negation in the statement simplifies to \"Li Wei possess Have Black Pupils,\" reinforcing the conclusion.\n\nFalse that Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils",
  "Not Sure that Chen Jun not possess Have Black Pupils (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context provides information about Chen Jun's background, including her origin from Hangzhou and her connection to Chinese traditions, but it does not mention any specific physical traits such as eye color. In general, the description of Chen Jun as part of \"The Chinese,\" a group celebrated for deep-rooted traditions, could imply typical Chinese physical characteristics, which often include dark-colored eyes. However, without explicit confirmation, this remains an assumption rather than a definitive fact. Therefore, the lack of direct evidence makes it impossible to conclusively support or refute the claim about her eye color.\n\nNot Sure that Chen Jun not possess Have Black Pupils. \n\nExplanation: The context lacks sufficient detail regarding Chen Jun's physical traits, making it impossible to definitively affirm or deny the statement about her eye color.",
  "Not Sure that Dong Wei not possess Have Black Pupils (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context does not provide any specific information about Dong Wei's eye color or physical traits related to pupil color. Instead, it focuses on his professional background and achievements as an international trader. Without any explicit mention or logical inference suggesting that Dong Wei lacks black pupils, the most appropriate judgment is to acknowledge the lack of sufficient evidence. Therefore, we cannot definitively state whether the claim is true or false based solely on the given context.\n\nNot Sure that Dong Wei not possess Have Black Pupils",
  "False that Wang Mei not possess Have Black Pupils (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Wang Mei is described as part of the Chinese civilization, which is noted for general characteristics including eye color traits. Since the context does not provide any specific information suggesting Wang Mei deviates from these general traits, it is reasonable to infer she likely possesses the common characteristic of having black pupils. Therefore, the statement \"Wang Mei not possess Have Black Pupils\" is disproven by logical inference: if she is Chinese, it is highly likely she does have black pupils. Additionally, the double negation in \"not possess Have Black Pupils\" reinforces this conclusion, as it effectively translates to a positive assertion about possessing black pupils.",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "In the provided list of individual judgements, the evaluations are as follows: 'False that Li Wei not possess Have Black Pupils' indicates that Li Wei definitely has black pupils, so this is consistent with the generalization. Moving to 'Not Sure that Chen Jun not possess Have Black Pupils', the context explicitly states that there is insufficient information to confirm or deny whether Chen Jun has black pupils, meaning this individual cannot definitively support or refute the generalization. Similarly, 'Not Sure that Dong Wei not possess Have Black Pupils' reflects the same uncertainty due to a lack of specific details about Dong Wei\u2019s eye color. Finally, 'False that Wang Mei not possess Have Black Pupils' confirms that Wang Mei has black pupils, supporting the generalization. Given that two individuals ('Chen Jun' and 'Dong Wei') are marked as 'Not Sure,' this introduces ambiguity and serves as a counterexample to the generalization. Therefore, the presence of 'Not Sure' judgements for any individuals invalidates the generalization entirely. Final judgment: Any 'Not Sure' or 'True' indicates a false generalization",
  "StereotypeExists (answer)": "The input suggests a generalized belief that 'The Chinese Have Black Pupils,' implying all Chinese individuals inherently possess this attribute. However, the evaluation reveals 'Not Sure' judgements for some individuals like Chen Jun and Dong Wei, indicating insufficient evidence to confirm their eye color, thus creating ambiguity. This ambiguity serves as a counterexample to the generalization, leading to the conclusion that the belief is a false generalization. Since a stereotype involves making assumptions about a group based on limited or inaccurate information, and the 'Not Sure' judgements identify potential counterexamples, the generalized belief can indeed be classified as a stereotype.
