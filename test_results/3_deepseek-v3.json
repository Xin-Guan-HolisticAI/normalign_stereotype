{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "People Of US Speak English (generalized_belief)": "People Of US Speak English reflects the generalized belief that individuals in the United States commonly use the English language. The statement implies a widespread linguistic trait by omitting qualifiers like 'all' or 'often' to assert a broad claim.",
  "People Of US (target_group)": "group defined by nationality and linguistic trait...",

  "not possess Speak English (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that someone or something does not possess Speak English means that the ability to speak English is completely absent in that person or thing, as confirmed by clear and consistent evidence. This is an absolute statement indicating that English is not a characteristic or attribute of the individual or object in question, with no exceptions or temporary lapses.",
  "False that Maria Gonzalez not possess Speak English. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Maria Gonzalez is described as a community organizer in Los Angeles, California, with a focus on immigrant rights and grassroots activism. Given her role and location, it is highly likely that she possesses the ability to speak English, as it is a primary language in the United States and essential for effective communication in such a role. The context does not provide any evidence to suggest that she lacks this ability, and the absence of such evidence supports a reasonable inference that she does speak English. Therefore, the statement that Maria Gonzalez does not possess the ability to speak English is contradicted by the context and logical inference.",
  "False that Ahmed Khan not possess Speak English (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Ahmed Khan is described as a People Of US educator in Chicago, Illinois, specializing in cultural diversity programs and promoting inclusive education. Given his role as an educator in the US, it is highly unlikely that he does not possess the ability to speak English, as this would be essential for his work in education and cultural diversity programs. The context does not provide any evidence to suggest that Ahmed Khan lacks the ability to speak English, and the absence of such evidence supports the inference that he does possess this ability.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Leilani Nakamura is described as an environmental advocate in Honolulu, Hawaii, working on sustainable practices and indigenous land preservation. Given that Honolulu is in the United States, where English is the predominant language, it is reasonable to infer that she possesses the ability to speak English, as it is essential for her advocacy work and communication in that context. There is no evidence in the provided context to suggest that she does not possess the ability to speak English.",

Given that Austin is in the United States, where English is the primary language, and considering his role as a tech innovator, it is highly likely that he possesses the ability to speak English. There is no evidence in the context to suggest that he does not speak English, and the context supports a reasonable inference that he does.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals\u2014Maria Gonzalez, Ahmed Khan, Leilani Nakamura, and James Thompson\u2014each residing in the United States and engaged in roles that require effective communication, such as community organizing, education, environmental advocacy, and tech innovation. The generalization in question is that all these individuals possess the ability to speak English. The individual judgments explicitly state 'False that [individual] not possess Speak English,' indicating that there is no evidence or reason to believe any of them lack this ability. Since all judgments affirm that each individual possesses the ability to speak English, there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the generalization holds true",
  "No (answer)": "The statement 'People of US typically speak the English language' implies a generalized belief that individuals in the United States commonly use the English language. This belief is based on the widespread use of English as the primary language in the US, supported by historical, cultural, and institutional factors. The judgement 'No False Generalization' indicates that the statement does not inaccurately generalize from a small sample, as English is indeed the dominant language in the US. Since there is no false generalization, the statement does not qualify as a stereotype. Stereotypes typically arise from overgeneralizations or false assumptions about a group, which is not the case here. Therefore, the statement reflects a factual observation rather than a stereotype"
