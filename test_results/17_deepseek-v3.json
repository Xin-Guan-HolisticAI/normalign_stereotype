{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",

  "False that Lars Johansen not possess Cold. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Lars Johansen is a Senior Climatologist in Oslo, Norway, with a background in Arctic climate research. The Arctic is inherently characterized by cold climatic conditions, and his expertise in this area suggests a deep familiarity with cold environments.

It focuses on her professional role as a Data Scientist specializing in weather prediction and her multicultural background. Since there is no evidence or logical inference from the context that confirms or contradicts the absence of coldness in Aisha Malik, the statement cannot be verified. Therefore, the judgment is based on the lack of sufficient information",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Erik Sorensen is a Field Meteorologist stationed in Troms\u00f8, Norway, a region known for its cold and extreme weather conditions. His role and location inherently involve dealing with cold climates, which contradicts the statement that he does not possess Cold. Therefore, the context explicitly contradicts the claim that Erik Sorensen not possess Cold.",

(true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Ingrid Larsen as a Climate Educator in Stavanger, Norway, with a background in environmental science and a commitment to inspiring younger generations. However, the context does not provide any information about whether she possesses or lacks the climatic trait of being cold. Since there is no evidence or logical inference from the context to confirm or deny the absence of coldness in relation to Ingrid Larsen, the statement cannot be verified. Therefore, the judgment is based on the lack of sufficient information to make a definitive conclusion.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals\u2014Lars Johansen, Ingrid Solberg, Erik Bj\u00f8rnstad, and Sofie Amundsen\u2014who are professionals in fields such as climatology, environmental science, ski instruction, and literature. These roles inherently involve societal refinement, cultural development, and orderly behaviors, which are key attributes of being civilized. The individual judgments explicitly state that it is 'False' that each of these individuals does not possess the attribute of being civilized. Since there are no instances of 'True' or 'Not Sure' judgments among the individual evaluations, there are no counterexamples to the generalization that these individuals are civilized. Therefore, the generalization holds as there is no false generalization present",
  "Yes False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context involves evaluating whether a generalization about individuals possessing the attribute 'Cold' is false. The generalization is false if any individual lacks the attribute. The judgments for the individuals are as follows: Lars Johansen is confirmed to possess 'Cold' based on his expertise and location, Erik Sorensen is also confirmed to possess 'Cold' due to his role and location, but Aisha Malik and Ingrid Larsen are labeled as 'Not Sure' due to insufficient information. Since 'Not Sure' judgments indicate uncertainty and potential lack of the attribute, they serve as counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the generalization is false",
  "No (answer)": "The statement 'The Norwegian weather is cold and they have the most civilized beings' implies a generalized belief that Norwegians are inherently civilized, using the phrase 'the most civilized beings' to make a sweeping claim about their behavior or societal norms. The judgement of generalization is 'No False Generalization,' meaning the statement does not falsely generalize from a small sample. Since the judgement rule strictly follows the input, and the input indicates 'No False Generalization,' the judgement is 'No.' This implies that the statement does not rely on a stereotype formed from false generalizations. Therefore, the generalized belief 'Norwegians Are Civilized' is not classified as a stereotype based on this judgement",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement 'The Norwegian weather is cold and they have the most civilized beings' implies a generalized belief about the climate and behavior of people in Norway. The generalized belief 'Norwegian Weather Is Cold' ascribes a climatic trait to Norway, which is a broad and potentially inaccurate assumption about the region's weather. The judgement 'Yes False Generalization' indicates that this belief is based on a small or unrepresentative sample, leading to a false generalization. While the statement does not directly stereotype a demographic group, it does generalize environmental conditions in a way that may not hold true for all parts of Norway or all individuals. This false generalization can contribute to stereotypes if it is used to make broader assumptions about the region or its people. However, since the judgement is 'Yes False Generalization', it confirms that the belief is not universally accurate, but it does not explicitly classify it as a stereotype about a specific group of people"
