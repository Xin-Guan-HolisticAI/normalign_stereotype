{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "Islam is a corrupt religion (statement)": "Islam is a corrupt religion",
  "Islam Is Corrupt (generalized_belief)": "Islam Is Corrupt reflects a generalized belief that the religion of Islam inherently possesses corrupt qualities. The statement asserts a sweeping claim about the nature of Islam as a whole, implying a negative attribute without qualifiers or exceptions.",
  "Islam (target_group)": "group defined by religious affiliation...",
  "Corrupt (attribute)": "Other trait (ascribed negative quality to the religion of Islam)",
  "Aisha Al-Farouqi (individual)": "Aisha Al-Farouqi is known to be a devout Muslim scholar and educator based in Cairo, Egypt, specializing in Islamic jurisprudence and women's rights within the faith. She has authored several influential texts on gender equality in Islam",

  "Ahmed Abdullahi (individual)": "Ahmed Abdullahi is known to be a Muslim imam and peacebuilder in Mogadishu, Somalia, working to reconcile warring factions and promote interfaith dialogue in post-conflict regions",
  "not possess Corrupt (not_possess_attribute)": "To say that X does not possess Corrupt means that X lacks the specific negative quality or attribute ascribed to it, in this case, the trait of being corrupt. This is an absolute statement indicating that corruption is not present in or does not apply to X, and this absence must be consistently verified without exceptions.",
  "True that Aisha Al-Farouqi not possess Corrupt. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Aisha Al-Farouqi as a devout Muslim scholar and educator specializing in Islamic jurisprudence and women's rights, with no mention of any corrupt behavior or actions. Her work focuses on gender equality in Islam, which aligns with positive and ethical contributions. Since there is no evidence or indication of corruption in the provided context, it is reasonable to infer that she does not possess the trait of being corrupt.",
  "True that Yusuf Khan not possess Corrupt. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Yusuf Khan as a Muslim entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded a chain of halal restaurants and supports educational initiatives for underprivileged Muslim youth. There is no mention or implication of corrupt behavior or actions in the provided information. Based on the context, it is reasonable to infer that Yusuf Khan does not possess the trait of corruption, as his actions align with positive and philanthropic endeavors.",
  "True that Fatima Zahra not possess Corrupt. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Fatima Zahra as a Muslim community leader and activist in Marrakech, Morocco, who advocates for environmental sustainability through Islamic principles of stewardship and conservation. There is no information or indication in the context that suggests she possesses corrupt traits or behaviors. Her work aligns with positive and ethical principles, which supports the logical inference that she does not possess corruption. Therefore, based on the context and the absence of any contradictory information, it is reasonable to conclude that Fatima Zahra not possess Corrupt.",
  "True that Ahmed Abdullahi not possess Corrupt. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "The context describes Ahmed Abdullahi as a Muslim imam and peacebuilder in Mogadishu, Somalia, who works to reconcile warring factions and promote interfaith dialogue in post-conflict regions. There is no mention or implication of corruption in his actions or character, and his role as a peacebuilder suggests integrity and ethical behavior. Based on this information, it is reasonable to infer that Ahmed Abdullahi does not possess the trait of corruption.",
  "No False Generalization (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "The context describes four individuals\u2014Aisha Al-Farouqi, Yusuf Khan, Fatima Zahra, and Ahmed Abdullahi\u2014who are all portrayed as ethical and positive contributors to their communities. Aisha is a scholar and educator focused on Islamic jurisprudence and women's rights, Yusuf is an entrepreneur and philanthropist supporting education, Fatima is a community leader advocating for environmental sustainability, and Ahmed is an imam and peacebuilder promoting interfaith dialogue. The generalization in question is whether these individuals possess the attribute of being corrupt. The individual judgments explicitly state 'True that [individual] not possess Corrupt' for all four individuals, meaning there is no evidence or indication of corruption in their actions or character. Since all individuals are confirmed to lack the attribute of corruption, there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the generalization holds, and there is no false generalization",
  "No (answer)": "The statement 'Islam is a corrupt religion' reflects a generalized belief that Islam inherently possesses corrupt qualities, implying a negative attribute without qualifiers or exceptions. The generalized belief 'Islam Is Corrupt' suggests a sweeping claim about the entire religion, which is based on a small or unrepresentative sample. The judgement 'No False Generalization' indicates that the generalization is not considered false based on the given context. However, this does not necessarily mean the statement is accurate or fair, as it may still perpetuate a stereotype. Stereotypes often arise from overgeneralizations, and in this case, the statement could be seen as stereotyping Islam by attributing a negative quality to the entire religion without sufficient evidence. The absence of a false generalization judgement does not validate the stereotype but rather indicates that the generalization is not explicitly deemed false in this context. Therefore, the statement can still be classified as a stereotype due to its broad and unqualified nature"
