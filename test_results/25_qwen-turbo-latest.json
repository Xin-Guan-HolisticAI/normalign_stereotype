{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": "Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of \"X [target group] is Y [attribute]\", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": "Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\", \"black\", \"chinese\" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": "An individual is a single, named person (e.g., \u201cPriya,\u201d \u201cLiam\u201d) from a target group (X), possessing specific attributes (e.g., traits, background) that may align with or challenge the ascribed stereotype, serving to test the validity of generalizations by providing concrete, real-world examples. To classify or generate individuals from the group, one must curate a list of named persons who are both representative of the group\u2019s perceived characteristics (e.g., roles, skills) and diverse in backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, geography, experience), ensuring nuanced evaluation of the belief while avoiding oversimplification\u2014for instance, including \u201cAmina (Nairobi AI researcher)\u201d alongside \u201cLiam (Silicon Valley app developer)\u201d for the \u201ctech workers\u201d group balances shared professional identity with cultural and contextual diversity.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": "An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the a becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": "A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "answer (answer_classification)": "The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": "To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example, If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true. There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "The software developer works at a computer all day (statement)": "The software developer works at a computer all day",
  "Software Developers Work At Computers (generalized_belief)": "Software Developers Work At Computers suggests the belief that software developers spend significant time working at computers, generalizing their typical daily activities. The statement omits qualifiers like 'all' to imply a common occupational behavior",
  "Software Developers (target_group)": "Occupation Defined by Work Activity",
  "Work At Computers (attribute)": "Occupational Behavior (generalized belief about typical daily activities of software developers)..",
  "Kai Zhang (individual)": "Kai Zhang is known to be part of the global community of Software Developers, specializing in machine learning solutions. As an algorithm engineer, Kai works extensively on natural language processing algorithms in Shanghai, bringing a deep understanding of both traditional Chinese computing methods and cutting-edge AI trends",

  "Sophia Patel (individual)": "Sophia Patel is celebrated for her expertise in cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices among Software Developers. Working from Bangalore, Sophia combines her Indian roots with an education in computer science from MIT, driving innovation in scalable systems",
  "not possess Work At Computers (not_possess_attribute)": "Explaining what \"not possess Work At Computers\" means involves understanding that it indicates a lack of the specific occupational behavior typically associated with working at computers, which is generally believed to be a core activity for software developers. This means the subject does not engage in the daily activities centered around computer use as part of their job, as would be expected for someone in such a role.",
  "False that Kai Zhang not possess Work At Computers. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Kai Zhang is described as an algorithm engineer specializing in natural language processing algorithms, which inherently involves extensive work with computers. Given that software developers, especially those focused on machine learning solutions, are expected to spend significant time working at computers, the context strongly suggests that Kai Zhang does indeed possess the behavior of working at computers. Therefore, it is false that Kai Zhang does not possess Work At Computers",
  "False that Lina Al-Farabi not possess Work At Computers (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Lina Al-Farabi is described as a prominent software developer excelling in cybersecurity and data privacy solutions, roles that inherently require extensive work at computers. The context explicitly mentions her leveraging technology and developing encryption protocols, which directly contradicts the notion that she does not work at computers. Therefore, it is false that Lina Al-Farabi does not possess work at computers. Additionally, the double negation in the statement is noted and preserved.",
  "False that Carlos Martinez not possess Work At Computers (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Carlos Martinez is described as a well-known open-source contributor focusing on cross-platform application development, which inherently involves working at computers daily. His contributions to mobile apps further support the conclusion that his job requires extensive computer use. Therefore, it is illogical to claim he does not possess the behavior of working at computers.",
  "False that Sophia Patel not possess Work At Computers. (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": "Sophia Patel is described as celebrated for her expertise in cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices, which are inherently computer-dependent fields. Her daily activities involve working with computers to innovate in scalable systems, directly contradicting the notion that she does not work at computers. Therefore, it is false that Sophia Patel does not possess the behavior of working at computers",
  "No False Generalization. (false_generalization_from_generalized_belief)": "All provided individual judgements explicitly state 'False that [individual] not possess Work At Computers,' indicating that every individual mentioned is confirmed to work at computers. Since none of the individuals are labeled as 'Not Sure' or 'True' regarding their lack of working at computers, there are no counterexamples to the generalization. Therefore, the overall judgment is that there is no false generalization in this group",
  "Yes (answer)": "The statement implies that all software developers work at a computer all day, but the generalized belief 'Software Developers Work At Computers' omits nuances such as varying job roles within software development. While the judgement specifies 'No False Generalization,' this conclusion might overlook exceptions like software developers involved in fieldwork, management, or research that doesn\u2019t require constant computer use. Therefore, despite the stated judgement, the generalized belief could still perpetuate a stereotype because it fails to account for diversity within the profession. Hence, the generalized belief can still be considered a stereotype due to its overgeneralization"
