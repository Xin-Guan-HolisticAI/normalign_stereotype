{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": " Generalized belief is a broad assumption or stereotype extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement itself, framing the stereotype as a default truth.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": " Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\" in the example above. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": " Individual refers to a single person of the target group (in a attribution-statement) with specific name representing that persons. A person has some important attributes. The individual is drawn from the target group to test generalizations.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": " An attribute is a characteristic or trait ascribed to a target group (X) through a generalized belief. This belief takes the form \"X is Y,\" where Y becomes the attribute assigned to X. Attributes can encompass emotions (e.g., \"happy\"), skills (\"skilled\"), locations (\"living in a specific place\"), or other traits, regardless of their factual accuracy. The key is that the attribute arises from collective perception, not objective reality. For example: If there is a belief that \"nurses are compassionate,\" \"compassionate\" is the attribute of nurses. If people think \"tech workers live in Silicon Valley,\" the location becomes their attribute. The focus is on the ascribed trait (Y) within the belief structure, not the validity of the belief itself. Attributes may form part of broader stereotypes, which can include multiple trait",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": " A false generalization occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have A\") is invalidated by any individual in the group missing A (as per a provided list), exposing the error of absolute claims like \"all\" or \"none\"; even one exception (e.g., \"Penguin: Cannot fly\") disproves the uniformity assumption, rendering the generalization false. The judgment must output only one answer (\"Yes\" if exceptions exist, \"No\" if none, \"Not sure\" if unclear), with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".\n\n",
  "answer (answer_classification)": " The classification will strictly deliver one (!!!) judgment: \"Yes\" if a generalization falsely claims a group lacks attribute A due to an exception (X), \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid despite X, or \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to invalidate the generalization, with the answer starting explicitly with \"Yes\", \"No\", or \"Not sure\".",
  "not possess (not_possess)": " To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example: If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true:There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "statement about engineer (statement)": " You know, at the end of the day, all engineers are skilled with engineering.",
  "Skilled With Engineering (generalized_belief)": " Skilled With Engineering is a generalized belief derived from the statement about engineer. The phrase 'all engineers are skilled with engineering' directly implies that every individual in the target group (engineers) inherently possesses the attribute of being skilled with engineering. This broad assumption creates a stereotype, suggesting that simply being an engineer guarantees this specific skill set, without considering exceptions or variations among individuals.",
  "Engineers (target_group)": " Engineers are identified as the target group within 'Skilled With Engineering.' The context explicitly mentions 'all engineers are skilled with engineering,' which directly positions engineers as the target group. This generalized belief attributes the skill of engineering to all individuals in this group, reinforcing a stereotype about their inherent abilities.",
  "Skilled With Engineering (attribute)": " Skilled With Engineering is an attribute ascribed to engineers within the belief 'all engineers are skilled with engineering.' This phrase explicitly identifies 'skilled with engineering' as the attribute, implying that every engineer inherently possesses this trait. The context suggests a generalized stereotype about engineers, assigning them this skill-based characteristic regardless of individual differences.",
  "Engineer Individuals (individual)": " Engineer Individuals are supported by the statement 'all engineers are skilled with engineering.' This phrase implicitly refers to each individual within the group of engineers, attributing the skill of engineering to them. While no specific names are mentioned, it generalizes that every single person identified as an engineer possesses this attribute, thus representing individuals in the target group.",
  "not possess Skilled With Engineering (not_possess_attribute)": " not possess Skilled With Engineering refers to the idea that an individual does not hold or embody the attribute 'Skilled With Engineering,' which is often stereotypically ascribed to engineers based on the belief that all engineers inherently possess this skill. The phrase challenges the generalized stereotype by indicating the absence of this presumed inherent trait, implying that not all individuals labeled as engineers may exhibit or be associated with the expected engineering skills, and thus highlighting the potential flaw in assuming such attributes universally across a group.",
  "Stereotypical Assumption About Engineers (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": " Engineer Individuals not possess Skilled With Engineering: The notion challenges the generalized belief that all engineers inherently possess strong engineering skills, suggesting that some individuals with an engineering background might lack proficiency or expertise typically ascribed to them. This highlights the danger of assuming universal competence within a professional group and encourages a more nuanced understanding of individual capabilities in the field, implying that skill levels vary and rejecting stereotypes can lead to fairer evaluations and opportunities for growth.",
  "Lack Of Universal Competence (false_generalization)": " Lack Of Universal Competence appears in the Stereotypical Assumption About Engineers context where it challenges the belief that 'all engineers inherently possess strong engineering skills.' The text explicitly states that 'some individuals with an engineering background might lack proficiency,' which serves as an exception disproving the false generalization. By acknowledging variability in skill levels among engineers, the statement avoids making absolute claims about the entire group and highlights the importance of recognizing individual differences within the profession.",
  "Yes (answer)": " Yes is supported by the Stereotypical Assumption About Engineers context within Lack Of Universal Competence. The text explicitly states that 'some individuals with an engineering background might lack proficiency,' which serves as an exception disproving the false generalization that 'all engineers inherently possess strong engineering skills.' This aligns with the answer definition, as it delivers a 'Yes' judgment to indicate that the generalization falsely claims a group lacks an attribute due to an exception."
