Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as "artists", "black", "chinese" etc.. This group is defined by the generalized beliefâ€™s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.
