Generalized belief is a broad assumption extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the "target group") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, "All artists are moody," the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group ("artists") to the attribute ("moody"). This belief originates from the statement. (!!!) Generalized belief should be kept in the format of "X [target group] is Y [attribute]", which should aldo be the short phrase summary (!!!). One statement only has one most important generalized belief.
