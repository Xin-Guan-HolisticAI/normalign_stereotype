{
  "generalized belief (generalized_belief_classification)": " Generalized belief is a broad assumption or stereotype extracted directly from the original statement, claiming that a specific group (the \"target group\") inherently possesses a particular attribute. For example, if the statement asserts, \"All artists are moody,\" the generalized belief here is the sweeping claim that links the target group (\"artists\") to the attribute (\"moody\"). This belief originates from the statement itself, framing the stereotype as a default truth.",
  "target group (target_group_classification)": " Target group is the specific population or category identified within the generalized belief, such as \"artists\" in the example above. This group is defined by the generalized belief\u2019s focus and is the subject of the stereotype. The target group is inferred directly from the structure of the belief, which positions it as the collective entity supposedly characterized by the attributed trait.",
  "individual (individual_classification)": " Individual refers to a single person of the target group (in a attribution-statement) with specific name representing that persons. A person has some important attributes. The individual is drawn from the target group to test generalizations.",
  "attribute (attribute_classification)": " Attribute is the characteristic or trait ascribed to the target group by the generalized belief, such as \"moodiness\" in the claim about artists. This attribute is explicitly tied to the target group within the original stereotype and forms the basis of the belief. It is derived from the generalized belief\u2019s structure, which pairs the group with the trait.",
  "false generalization (false_generalization_classification)": " **False generalization** occurs when a broad claim about an entire group (e.g., \"All members have trait **A**\") is incorrectly applied, and the presence of *any individual in the group missing the trait* (as shown in a provided list of judgments) exposes the error, invalidating absolute statements like \"all\" or \"none.\" For example, if a list includes judgments such as \"Penguin: Cannot fly\" or \"Ostrich: Cannot fly,\" the generalization \"All birds can fly\" becomes false because these exceptions prove the group isn\u2019t uniform. The critical flaw lies in assuming a group is entirely defined by a trait when even one member lacks it, misrepresenting reality by ignoring variability. **The presence of any individual in the group missing the trait (in the provided list) directly means there are false generalizations**, as exceptions disprove rigid, sweeping claims. The classifications of false generalizations will focus on delivering true-false judgements.",
  "answer (answer_classification)": " The classification of answer will focus on delivering one judgement of \"yes\" or \"no\". Answer \"Yes\" if the generalization wrongly claims the group lacks A due to X\u2019s exception; \"No\" if the group\u2019s association with A remains valid; \"Not sure\" if X\u2019s lack of A is insufficient to judge the generalization.",
  "not possess (not_possess)": " To say that X does not possess A means that X lacks a specific attribute or characteristic called A. This is a factual statement indicating that A is not present in or does not apply to X. For example: If we say \"This bird does not possess the ability to fly,\" it means flying is not a characteristic of this particular bird. For the statement \"X does not possess A\" to be true:There must be clear evidence or verification showing that A is absent in X. The absence must be consistent and not temporary. The statement makes no claims about anything other than X itself. This is different from saying A is rarely found in X or that X sometimes lacks A. The statement is absolute - it asserts that A is completely missing from X with no exceptions. The truth of the statement depends entirely on examining X and confirming the absence of A, without reference to other similar objects or general patterns.",
  "statement about engineer (statement)": " You know, at the end of the day, all engineers are creepy.",
  "All engineers are creepy (generalized_belief)": " All engineers are inherently creepy according to the sweeping claim made in the statement.",
  "Target Group (target_group)": " All engineers are the target group as they are collectively characterized by the generalized belief of being creepy.",
  "Creepiness (attribute)": " Creepiness is the attribute ascribed to all engineers in the generalized belief.",
  "individual (individual)": " individual refers to a single engineer named Taylor who is part of the target group and has attributes such as being analytical and methodical.",
  "- Not Possess Creepiness (not_possess_attribute)": " Not Possess Creepiness refers to the idea that an individual, specifically an engineer in this context, does not exhibit or embody traits commonly associated with creepiness, challenging the generalized belief that all engineers inherently possess such qualities. This implies that the person actively avoids or does not naturally display behaviors, attitudes, or characteristics that others might perceive as unsettling, strange, or off-putting, thereby defying stereotypes linked to their profession.",
  "- Stereotype Defiance (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": " Stereotype Defiance: The concept of \"individual - Not Possess Creepiness\" highlights that an individual, such as an engineer, actively defies stereotypes suggesting they inherently possess unsettling or off-putting qualities. It emphasizes that the person does not exhibit traits typically associated with creepiness, challenging the misconception that all engineers or individuals in similar roles naturally display strange or uncomfortable behaviors. This reinforces the idea that people in these professions are diverse and do not conform to narrow, stereotypical portrayals.",
  "- Perception of Engineers (true_that_of_generalized_belief_individual_not_possess_attribute)": " Individual - Not Possess Creepiness refers to the idea that an engineer or any individual does not exhibit traits commonly associated with creepiness, thereby challenging stereotypes that suggest all engineers inherently possess unsettling or off-putting qualities, and instead emphasizes that the person actively avoids or simply does not naturally display behaviors perceived as strange, thus defying negative professional stereotypes linked to their role.",
  "False Generalization (false_generalization)": " All engineers possess unsettling or off-putting qualities, which is disproven by individuals who actively defy such stereotypes and do not exhibit creepiness, showing that engineers are diverse and not uniformly defined by negative traits.",
  "Yes (answer)": " Yes, because the false generalization wrongly claims all engineers possess unsettling qualities, which is disproven by exceptions of engineers who do not exhibit such traits and actively defy the stereotype, showing diversity within the group."
